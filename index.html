Fleeing religious persecution, the hardworking, pious Pilgrims thrived in the wilds of New England, where they built their fabled &#x201c;shining city on a hill.&#x201d; Legend goes that the colony in Jamestown was a false start, offering a cautionary tale of lazy louts hunted gold till they starved and shiftless settlers who had to be rescued by English food and the hard discipline of martial law. </p><p>Neither story is true. In <i>Marooned</i>, Joseph Kelly re-examines the history of Jamestown and comes to a radically different and decidedly American interpretation of these first Virginians. </p><p>In this gripping account of shipwrecks and mutiny in America's earliest settlements, Kelly argues that the colonists at Jamestown were literally and figuratively marooned, cut loose from civilization, and cast into the wilderness. The British caste system meant little on this frontier: those who wanted to survive had to learn to work and fight and intermingle with the nearby native populations. Ten years before the Mayflower Compact and decades before Hobbes and Locke, they invented the idea of government by the people. 150 years before Jefferson, the colonists discovered the truth that all men were equal. </p><p>The epic origin of America was not an exodus and a fledgling theocracy. It is a tale of shipwrecked castaways of all classes marooned in the wilderness fending for themselves in any way they could--a story that illuminates who we are as a nation today.</p></p><p><b>Joseph Kelly</b> is a professor of literature at the College of Charleston and a member of the American Studies Association. He is the author of <i>America's Longest Siege</i>:<i> Charleston, Slavery, and the Slow March Toward Civil War</i>, and the editor of the <i>Seagull Reader </i>series. He lives in Charleston, South Carolina.<p>&#x201c;[A] stimulating history of Jamestown . . . a superb portrait of the founding, combining brilliant detail with epic sweep.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Starred review, Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;An insightful re-examination of the 1607 Jamestown settlement . . . Kelly's lively, heavily researched, frequently gruesome account gives a slight nod to Jamestown as the 'better place to look for the genesis of American ideals.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Starred review, Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;The U.S. loves its creation myths, and this mythmaking, myth-breaking history gives us a new character, Stephen Hopkins... Though Hopkins and those like him left few records, Kelly fleshes out the available glimpses with a vivid, detailed description of the settlement and its English and Native American contexts...Kelly's dynamic narrative brings Jamestown to life and shows how history reflects the present as well as the past.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>starred review, Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Kelly has woven a tapestry that is so dense in detail and so richly colored that it may become a kind of Bayeux Tapestry of the history of Jamestown.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Roanoke Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Despite the volume of this book and the controversial interpretations, it makes a fast easy adventure in reading. It includes the familiar such as John Smith but so much else.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Robert S. Davis, New York Journal of Books</i></p><p>&#x201c;Most amazing new book on early Virginia.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Anthony Comegna, Liberty Chronicles podcast</i></p><p>&#x201c;For historians interested in the challenges of colonization, this groundbreaking work will be well received.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>John Muller, Library Journal</i></p></p><h2>Blockchain: The Insights You Need from Harvard Business Review (HBR Insights Series)</h2><p><p><b>Can blockchain solve your biggest business problem?</b></p><p>While the world is transfixed by bitcoin mania, your competitors are tuning out the noise and making strategic bets on blockchain.

Set in the post-catastrophic future, in a peaceful, prosperous, corporate-controlled society where all dissent and non-conformity has been pathologized, and the human race is being genetically corrected in order to establish everlasting peace on Earth, Zone 23 is a hilarious, heartbreaking affirmation of the anarchic human spirit, and a defiant departure from the norms of both the genre sci-fi and literary novel.</p><p>C.

What the difference is between mature and immature love? What role sex plays in romantic love, and whether love necessarily implies sexual exclusivity? And, most important, how can we make love last? Originally published in 1980, this updated edition of <i>The Psychology of Romantic Love</i> explores the nature of romantic love on many levels-the philosophical, the historical, the sociological, and the physiological. Nathaniel Branden explains why so many people say that romantic love is just not possible in today's world and-drawing on his experience with thousands of couples-finds that such love is still a possibility for anyone who understands its essence and is willing to accept its challenges. <br><br> Branden sees it as a pathway not only to extraordinary joy but also to profound self-discovery.

His vision of love is at once passionate and thoroughly appropriate to our times and grounded in our nature as human beings. He reveals romantic love to be a pathway not only to extraordinary joy but also to profound self-discovery. Among the many challenging questions he explores are:<p></p><p>How does romantic love evolve?</p><p></p><p>What is the distinctive nature of romantic love?</p><p></p><p>What is the difference between mature and immature love?</p><p></p><p>What is the role of sex in romantic love?</p><p></p><p>Does romantic love necessarily imply sexual exclusivity?</p><p></p><p>How can we help romantic love to last?</p><p></p><p>How do we deal with jealousy?</p><p></p><p>For all those who long to love and yet wonder whether their dreams are attainable, <i>The Psychology Of Romantic Love </i> shows the way to translate dreams into reality.</p><b>Nathaniel Branden</b>'s pioneering work in the field of self-esteem&nbsp;over seven decades contributed to the evolution of the concept from obscurity to greater levels of clarity and acceptance.&nbsp;He wrote nearly 20 books on self-esteem, including such influential works as <i>The Psychology of Self-Esteem, How to Raise Your Self-Esteem, The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem,</i> and <i>The Art of Living Consciously</i>. In addition to his extensive work as a writer, Branden worked as a lecturer, therapist, and corporate consultant specializing in assisting modern businesses employ the principles of self-esteem to achieve greater levels of success.

After years of research and working with parents, Dina Rose discovered a powerful truth: when parents focus solely on nutrition, their kids - surprisingly - eat poorly. But when families shift their emphasis to behaviors - the skills and habits kids are taught - they learn to eat right. Every child can learn to eat well, but only if you show them how to do it. Dr. Rose describes the three habits - proportion, variety, and moderation - all kids need to learn, and gives you clever, practical ways to teach these food skills. With It&#39;s Not About The Broccoli you can teach your children how to eat and give them the skills they need for a lifetime of health and vitality.</p><p>Dina Rose, PHD, is a sociologist, parent educator and feeding expert with more than 15 years experience in teaching, research and public speaking. She has helped thousands of parents teach their children to eat right with her innovative approach to parenting. Dina has written for the Huffington Post and Psychology Today, and maintains an active blog on her website. She lives with her husband and daughter in Hoboken, New Jersey.&#x201c;An innovative approach to children&#x2019;s eating...Rose presents a thoughtfully crafted plan (the Teaching Approach) to form basic habits that focus on proportion, variety, and moderation. She helps parents identify their own eating hang ups when it comes to feeding their children (i.e. nurturer, food police, nutritionista) and then provides methods of helping children establish habits they can carry into adulthood...Rose walks readers through her Teaching Approach step-by-step, using scenarios that illustrate issues and hands-on solutions. Creative and clever, Rose comes to the table with a fresh perspective and a practical plan for teaching kids lifelong healthy eating habits.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>&#x201c;I am constantly hearing from parents that they have no idea what their kids are supposed to eat or whether their kids are eating &#x2018;right.&#x2019; [<i>It's Not About the Broccoli</i>] provides just what parents need to feed kids properly, stop worrying, and start enjoying mealtimes with kids. Dina Rose looks at feeding kids from a sociologist&#x2019;s perspective. When the feeding behavior goes well, kids will get all the nutrients they need. This book ought to reassure parents that following a few simple principles will get their kids fed just fine.&#x201d;<br>--<b>Marion Nestle</b>, Paulette Goddard Professor in the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health and Professor of Sociology at New York University, and author of <i>What to Eat</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Few things are as important to parents as feeding their kids healthy foods.&nbsp;Dina Rose offers parents a whole new way to think about feeding kids. Her suggestions are completely practical, completely effective, and often a lot of fun. Two thumbs up from this Sneaky Chef!&#x201d;<br>--<b>Missy Chase Lapine</b>, author of <i>The Sneaky Chef</i> cookbook series<br><br>&#x201c;Dr. Dina Rose is one of my &#x2018;go-to&#x2019; people on kids&#x2019; food issues. She provides practical, accessible, and science-based advice that should be of interest to all parents. Her approach, with its emphasis on behavioral strategies (and on the &#x2018;whole family&#x2019; approach to children&#x2019;s eating habits) is novel and important. Her ideas will spark useful debate on our approach to kids&#x2019; food, and she deserves the widest possible audience.&#x201d;<br><br>--<b>Karen Le Billon</b>, author of <i>French Kids Eat Everything: How Our Family Moved to France, Cured Picky Eating, Banned Snacking, and Discovered 10 Simple Rules for Raising Happy, Healthy Eaters</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Dina works hard to show parents how to get out of the nutrition trap in order to teach their kids to eat right, and her book provides parents with the &#x201c;aha&#x201d; moment they need to help their kids eat the real food that will help keep them both happy and healthy.&#x201d;<br>--<b>Kate Adamick</b>, co-founder of Cook for America and author of <i>Lunch Money: Serving Healthy School Food in a Sick Economy</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;In fifteen years of writing about nutrition and health for magazines such as <i>Parents</i>, <i>Family Circle</i>, and <i>Prevention</i>, I have interviewed hundreds of experts. Dr. Dina Rose has some of the freshest, most interesting advice I've heard on the topic of feeding kids. She challenges long-held beliefs and goes much deeper than many leading nutrition authorities. Dina has helped me on a personal level (she coached me through my toddler's dinner strike) and caused me to reevaluate some of my own beliefs about children's eating habits. Her focus on habits is perfect for our time, when so many parents know exactly what they should be feeding their kids--but just can't figure out how to do it.&#x201d;<br>--<b>Sally Kuzemchak</b>, MS, RD, Freelance Writer &amp; Registered Dietitian<br><br>&#x201c;Dina Rose will change how parents teach their children healthy eating habits. Her warmth and empathy shine through as she presents step-by-step practical solutions to worrisome issues such as picky eaters and kids with limited appetites. Combining scholarship with hands-on experience as a mother, Dina methodically analyzes what sabotages parents' best efforts to cope with challenging food issues. Dismissing the misplaced reliance on fuzzy nutritional data - as well as gimmicks and food fads - Dina highlights often ignored factors that significantly influence how our children view healthy eating.&#x201d;<br>--<b>Leah Klungness, Ph.D.</b>, psychologist and co-author of <i>The Complete Single Mother</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;As the managing editor at <i>New Jersey Family</i> magazine I'm exposed to a steady stream of tips for feeding picky eaters, but Dina's approach is different from the advice that typically comes my way.

Who is &#x201c;they&#x201d;?</i></p> <p><i>YUKIKO, YOU ARE WITH CHILD&#x2014;</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Yukiko.&#x201d;</p> <p>The girl opened her eyes, the sweet scent of burning cedar in her lungs. It took a moment to remember where she was. Who she was. What had brought them to this.</p> <p>She knelt beside a firepit in a simple house at the heart of a village in the trees. A bone-deep cold had slunk down from the mountains, hungry as ghosts, stealing through the Kag� stronghold and bringing the freezing promise of winter to come. Yukiko could smell it in the air, waiting at the edge of the stage. Storm clouds and white frost and black, black rain.</p> <p>Six others sat around the flames. The bleeding remnants of a beheaded rebellion.</p> <p>Soldiers without a captain?</p> <p>Or sheep without a shepherd?</p> <p>Kaori stared at Yukiko across the fire, steel-gray eyes bloodshot and circled with shadows. A long fringe was draped over the scar running forehead to chin, skin pale and drawn. She sat on Daichi&#x2019;s cushion at the head of the circle&#x2014;as his daughter, everyone assumed Kaori would take charge now the leader of the rebellion was gone.</p> <p><i>No, not gone</i>, Yukiko thought.</p> <p><i>Taken</i>.</p> <p>Other Kag� sat beside Kaori: Maro, the only other remaining member of the original council, long hair bound in warrior&#x2019;s braids, a leather patch over his missing eye. Beside him sat the Blackbird, the sky-ship captain who&#x2019;d flown them from Kigen&#x2019;s smoldering ruin. The man&#x2019;s scowl was almost hidden beneath an enormous straw hat, his beard as thick as hedgerows. Then there was Michi of course, small and razor sharp, a chainkatana and wakizashi marked with the sigils of a noble Tiger household across her back. Little Tomo, the black and white pup she&#x2019;d rescued from Aisha&#x2019;s chambers, sat in her lap, gnawing a knotted rope.</p> <p>Lightning arced across an angry horizon.</p> <p>The forest&#x2019;s pulse pounded inside Yukiko&#x2019;s head, the Kenning as loud and bright as she could ever remember. She tried to dim it, filtering it against a wall of herself. She could feel every living thing around her: swooping owls and fleeing mice and every life between, and burning above them all, the minds of every man and woman and child in the treetop village. Her hand strayed to her belly, to the two sparks of impossibly knotted heat she could sense inside her.</p> <p><i>Inside me.</i></p> <p>There was no room in her head for a thought that shape. No world where it could make any kind of sense.</p> <p>Akihito took her hand, his massive paw swallowing hers whole. She squeezed his fingers in return. After months spent believing he&#x2019;d died in Kigen jail, seeing him again had felt like coming home. They&#x2019;d sat together on the Blackbird&#x2019;s ship during the retreat from Kigen, the big man speaking of his missing months, his injured leg, finding the street-urchins Hana and Yoshi. Yukiko spoke of the gaijin lightning farm, the sea dragons, the Razor Isles. And at the very end, she&#x2019;d hung her head and spoken about what was growing inside her, swelling the Kenning beyond anything she&#x2019;d ever known.</p> <p>She&#x2019;d told him who the father was. He hadn&#x2019;t even blinked. Just wrapped her in one of those fearsome Akihito hugs, kissed her brow, and told her everything would be all right.</p> <p>He sat beside her now, hair tied back in cornrows. His right shoulder was wrapped in bandages, the Shogun&#x2019;s tattoo burned from his flesh. Yukiko remembered Daichi doing the same to her, here in this very room. The thought of the old man chained in some chapterhouse filled her heart with flame, her mind with burning images of the boy who&#x2019;d betrayed them all. Selling out the Kag� leader. Returning to the Guild he&#x2019;d once fled from. A boy who&#x2019;d said he loved her.</p> <p>She sighed, brushing her hand across her eyes.</p> <p><i>Gods, Kin, how could you?</i></p> <p>She could feel Kaiah circling high overhead, the female thunder tiger delighting in the rumbling storm. Buruu was curled up on the landing outside, watching her with wide eyes. Anxiety written in the sway of his tail, the tilt of his head. He feared for her.</p> <p><i>ARE YOU WELL, SISTER?</i></p> <p>Feared for the twins inside her.</p> <p><i>My Gods.</i></p> <p>She tried to swallow with a mouth dry as dust.</p> <p><i>Twins&nbsp;&#x2026; </i></p> <p>&#x201c;Yukiko,&#x201d; Kaori repeated. &#x201c;Are you well?&#x201d;</p> <p>She blinked. Shook her head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;m just tired.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re all tired. Sleep when you&#x2019;re dead.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; She sat up straighter, tossed the hair from her eyes. &#x201c;Go on.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Kaori said. &#x201c;We must plan our next steps. With Hiro&#x2019;s wedding foiled, the alliance between the Tiger and Dragon clan has crumbled. Daimyo Isamu of the Fox clan refused to even attend Hiro&#x2019;s wedding, so we can assume the Kitsune have no love for the Tigers either. This presents opportunity. An opportunity to purge the Guild from Shima once and for all.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We have bigger problems,&#x201d; Yukiko said. &#x201c;This Earthcrusher you spoke of will march soon, with Hiro leading the assault. Even if he doesn&#x2019;t have Aisha to tie him to the Kazumitsu line, fear of this machine might still make the other clanlords swear allegiance. Hiro already has the Phoenix armies at his command, and their Daimyo imprisoned. If the other clans unite with him and march north to the Iishi, we have nothing to throw against them.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And the Guild know exactly where we are,&#x201d; Michi said softly. &#x201c;The betrayer will have told them.&#x201d;</p> <p>The puppy climbed off the girl&#x2019;s lap, began snuffling at the corner.</p> <p>Yukiko nodded, swallowing bitter rage. &#x201c;We have to assume Kin told them everything. This forest won&#x2019;t hide us anymore. I think we should seek permission from the Fox Daimyo to move to Yama city. They have a fortress there, at least. A fleet. An army.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You asked us to place our faith in strangers before,&#x201d; Kaori said. &#x201c;Look where it led us.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;&#x2026; Are you saying Daichi&#x2019;s capture is <i>my</i> fault?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m saying my father is in Guild hands because we trusted the strangers you brought to our door. From now on, the Kag� stand alone.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t win this alone, Kaori.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No? Not even with the mighty Stormdancer at our side?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Kaori, I know you&#x2019;re angry at&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;My father is a captive because we put faith in your beloved Kin. And your once-lover Hiro is leading an army up here to annihilate us. Forgive me if I don&#x2019;t place much stock in your judgment, Stormdancer.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Kaori, I loved Daichi too&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that,&#x201d; Kaori snapped. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t speak about him like he&#x2019;s already gone.&#x201d;</p> <p>Michi&#x2019;s puppy began dancing in circles and barking at the roof, his tail a blur.</p> <p>&#x201c;Tomo!&#x201d; Michi hissed. &#x201c;Hush!&#x201d;</p> <p>Yukiko and Kaori stared at each other for an age, the crackling fire the only sound between them. Kaori&#x2019;s stare was almost hateful, finally broken as she turned to Akihito.</p> <p>&#x201c;What of the children you brought with you, Akihito-san? The gutter-waifs from Kigen? Two more fighters with the Kenning could be formidable allies, considering we now have two thunder tigers. If one could be taught to ride the female&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>The big man cleared his throat, cast an uncomfortable glance at Yukiko. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure we can ask much of them. Yoshi has a bad concussion, probably a fractured skull. Hana is shaken up pretty badly. She&#x2019;s not sleeping.&#x201d; He grimaced. &#x201c;Her eye is hurting something fierce.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Her eye is cause for concern,&#x201d; Kaori nodded.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll heal,&#x201d; Akihito shrugged. &#x201c;She just needs time.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, Akihito-san. Not the one plucked from her socket. The one that glows.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; A nod. &#x201c;Right.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What does your gaijin say about the girl, Stormdancer?&#x201d; Maro asked. &#x201c;The way he reacted when he first saw her&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>Yukiko was still staring at Kaori, shock at her words settling in her bones.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yukiko,&#x201d; repeated Maro. &#x201c;What does your gaijin say?&#x201d;</p> <p>She looked out to the silhouette on the landing. Piotr stood gazing into the forest, his wolf skin wrapped against the growing cold. His pipe illuminated the deep scars on his face, his blind eye, dark cropped hair and a pointed beard. Cinnamon-and-honey-scented smoke spilled from pale lips, lightning glinting on the iron brace at his knee.</p> <p>Buruu was swacking his tail against Piotr&#x2019;s legs, falling stone-still whenever the gaijin turned to glare. As soon as Piotr turned away, Buruu would swack him again. Piotr had helped them escape the lightning farm, and they both owed him a debt&#x2014;the thunder tiger was just showing affection in the most annoying way he knew how.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to understand him,&#x201d; Yukiko said. &#x201c;Piotr&#x2019;s Shiman is broken at best. He talks about Hana like she&#x2019;s&nbsp;&#x2026; touched or something. I saw a gaijin woman at that farm who had an eye like Hana&#x2019;s. Same color, same glow. They treated her like a holy woman.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You should speak to her,&#x201d; Michi said. &#x201c;Hana is strong as iron. And we&#x2019;ll need to wield every weapon we have against Hiro and his Earthcrusher. Whether we fight here or in Kitsune lands, two stormdancers are better than one.&#x201d;</p> <p>Yukiko nodded wearily.</p> <p>Little Tomo barked again, flaring the headache in Yukiko&#x2019;s head.</p> <p><i>LITTLE WOLF, IF YOU KEEP BARKING YOU WILL BE A LITTLE MEAL.</i></p> <p>Burru growled, long and low. Tomo tucked his tail and wisely fell silent.</p> <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s also this,&#x201d; Yukiko said. She produced a battered leather wallet, held it up to the assembled Kag�. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a letter. From the Artificer who fixed Piotr&#x2019;s leg. He was a captive of the gaijin, taught Piotr how to speak Shiman. If you can call it speaking&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;A letter from a Guildsman?&#x201d; Kaori narrowed her eyes. &#x201c;To whom?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;His lover.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Guildsmen do not have&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all true, Kaori. What Ayane told us. There <i>is</i> a rebellion within the Guild. Piotr&#x2019;s Artificer was a member. This is a letter to his lover, a woman named Misaki, asking her to fight on and bring the Guild down.&#x201d; She removed the worn paper from the wallet, held it up to the firelight. &#x201c;<i>And I will pray for you, for all the rebels that remain, that you may finish what we have started: Death to the Serpents. An end to the Guild. Freedom for Shima&#x2014;</i>&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Death to the Serpents?&#x201d; Michi frowned.</p> <p>Yukiko shrugged.</p> <p>Kaori&#x2019;s voice was a low hiss. &#x201c;My father is being tortured in some Guild hellpit right now because of that spider-legged bitch, Ayane. You expect us to believe anything she said?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Lies work best hidden between truths. If there&#x2019;s a group within the Guild looking to take it down from the inside, if this Misaki exists&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d have us take up arms beside chi-mongers?&#x201d; Michi was incredulous.</p> <p>&#x201c;You just said we&#x2019;re going to need every weapon we can get, Michi.&#x201d;</p> <p>Akihito frowned, rubbing his scarred thigh with dinner-plate hands. &#x201c;If the Guild have a rebel faction, some of those we killed in the attack on Kigen could have been&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; Yukiko stared at the fire, thinking of the Guild ships she&#x2019;d destroyed over the Iishi ranges. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re just like us. They see the wrong of it. And we&#x2019;ve been murdering them.&#x201d;</p> <p><i>THERE IS NO MURDER IN WAR.</i></p> <p>Buruu&#x2019;s thoughts rolled over her like storm clouds.</p> <p><i>Tell that to the ones they loved.</i></p> <p><i>YOU CANNOT BLAME YOURSELF, SISTER. YOU DID NOT KNOW.</i></p> <p><i>But I know now. We can&#x2019;t go on like this, Buruu. Whether they can add to our strength or not, we can&#x2019;t keep killing them. It&#x2019;s just wrong.</i></p> <p>&#x201c;May I see it?&#x201d; Kaori held out her hand. Yukiko passed over the letter, watched the older woman scan it with steel-gray eyes, her expression cold as snow.</p> <p>Tomo barked again, one high-pitched yap that made Yukiko flinch. A curse rose on her lips, and she turned on the dog, pouring into his skull, ready to shout for silence.</p> <p><i>&#x2026; silver razors&nbsp;&#x2026; </i></p> <p>She blinked, pupils dilating.</p> <p><i>&#x2026; red eye watching bad badbad&nbsp;&#x2026; </i></p> <p><i>SISTER, BEWARE!</i></p> <p>Buruu was on his feet, knocking Piotr aside and leaping onto the roof of Daichi&#x2019;s cabin. Two tons of muscle and beak and talon smashed the eaves to splinters, Maro crying out in alarm, Tomo yelping, the assemblage scattering as the ceiling partially collapsed.</p> <p>&#x201c;Maker&#x2019;s breath, what the hells is the matter with him?&#x201d; Kaori cried.</p> <p>Buruu landed amidst shattered timbers, shaking his head like a wolf savaging prey. As the Kag� stood dumbfounded, he opened his beak and spat onto the decking a crumpled ruin of silver clockwork and delicate spider legs, set with a windup key and a glowing red eye.</p> <p>&#x201c;Izanagi&#x2019;s balls,&#x201d; Michi hissed.</p> <p>The council gathered around the ruined machine, no more than a handful in size. One of the delicate legs twitched, blue sparks popping as the light in its eye slowly died. Buruu growled, a bass rumble felt deep in Yukiko&#x2019;s chest. The night fell deathly still.</p> <p>&#x201c;What the hells is that?&#x201d; Kaori hissed.</p> <p>Michi crouched low to the boards, eyes on the ruined machine. Her terrified puppy leapt into her arms, tail between his legs, eyes fixed on Buruu. The thunder tiger snorted once, tail moving side to side with easy, feline grace.</p> <p><i>GOOD EYES, LITTLE WOLF. PERHAPS I WON&#x2019;T EAT YOU AFTER ALL.</i></p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a Guild surveillance drone,&#x201d; Michi said. &#x201c;Kigen palace was full of them.&#x201d;</p> <p>Akihito nudged the thing with his boot. &#x201c;What do they do?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What they see, the Guild knows.&#x201d;</p> <p>The big man&#x2019;s eyes widened. He lifted his warclub and pounded it a little flatter.</p> <p>Michi clutched a terrified Tomo to her breast. &#x201c;Gods, it&#x2019;s dead, Akihito!&#x201d;</p> <p>The big man shrugged apology, smashed it once more for good measure.</p> <p>&#x201c;Where in the hells did it come from?&#x201d; Yukiko asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Stowed away on the <i>Kurea</i>, maybe?&#x201d; Akihito looked at the Blackbird.</p> <p>&#x201c;Amaterasu&#x2019;s tits, man.&#x201d; The captain raised one eyebrow. &#x201c;Why on earth would the Guild have drones aboard my ship? If they knew I was a Kag� sympathizer, they&#x2019;d have locked me in a torture cell faster than a Docktown strumpet lifts her kimono when the navy hits town.&#x201d;</p> <p>Michi scruffed her puppy&#x2019;s ears to calm him. &#x201c;One of the False-Lifers I killed in Aisha&#x2019;s bedchambers had a thing like this hidden in the orb on her back.&#x201d; She looked directly at Kaori. &#x201c;Maybe this one belonged to the False-Lifer you kept prisoner here?&#x201d;</p> <p>Yukiko&#x2019;s heart sank. &#x201c;Ayane&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;&#x2026; She was spying on us,&#x201d; Kaori breathed. &#x201c;Even locked in her cell, that bitch could see everything!&#x201d; She hurled the ruined machine into the firepit, voice rising with fury. &#x201c;Who knows how long it&#x2019;s been watching? And you want us to lay with these snakes, Yukiko?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Kaori, just&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Just what? The Lotus Guild has murdered our allies and friends! Butchered thousands of gaijin. If there <i>is</i> a rebellion within it, they&#x2019;re a pack of cowards, sitting on their hands while this country rushes toward the brink.&#x201d; Kaori turned to Maro. &#x201c;Get to the transmission station. We broadcast this news tonight. Name this Misaki openly. We&#x2019;ll see what the clanlords think when they find out the Guild itself has an insurrection brewing inside it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t do that,&#x201d; Yukiko said.</p> <p>&#x201c;You do not tell me what I can and cannot do, Stormdancer.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What do you think the Guild will do if you name her openly? They&#x2019;ll kill her, Kaori!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;One less chi-monger. Perhaps her death will spur her comrades into action.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Are you serious? Since when were we about murdering innocents?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Innocents?...</p></p><h2>Millennial Hospitality</h2><p>Millennial Hospitality is not like any other book you may have read about aliens.

Mick was a remarkable dog for many reasons, but one of his best talents was that he had trained himself to nod while I was talking. He was my dream companion: a handsome male who listened attentively and never interrupted or condescended. He also made me feel safe when I did my clandestine duties all over Pine Haven.</p><p>I shut the car door and moved up the walkway of Ellie Parker&#x2019;s house. She usually kept the door unlocked, though I had begged her to reconsider that idea. We had an agreement; if she wasn&#x2019;t there, or if she was out back puttering around in her garden, I could just leave the casserole on the table and take the money she left out for me. I charged fifty dollars, which included the price of ingredients. Ellie said I could charge more, but for now this little sideline of a job was helping me pay the bills, and that was good enough.</p><p>&#x201c;Ellie?&#x201d; I called. I went into her kitchen, where I&#x2019;d been several times before, and found it neat, as always; Ellie was not inside. Disappointed, I left the dish on her scrubbed wooden table. I had made a lovely mac and cheese casserole with a twist: finely sliced onion and prosciutto baked in with three different cheeses for a show-stopping event of a main course. It was delicious and very close to the way Ellie prepared it before her arthritis had made it too difficult to cook for her visiting friends and family. She didn&#x2019;t want her loved ones to know this, which was where I came in. We&#x2019;d had an agreement for almost a year, and it served us both well.</p><p>She knew how long to bake the dish, so I didn&#x2019;t bother with writing down any directions. Normally she would invite Mick in, and she and I would have some tea and shoot the breeze while my canine lounged under the table, but today, for whatever reason, she had made other plans. She hadn&#x2019;t set out the money, either, so I went to the cookie jar where she had told me to find my payment in the past: a ceramic cylinder in the shape of a chubby monkey. I claimed my money and turned around to find a man looming in the doorway.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; I screamed, clutching the cash in front of my waist like a weird bouquet.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; he said, his eyes narrowed. &#x201c;May I ask who you are?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a friend of Ellie&#x2019;s. Who are you?&#x201d; I fired back. Ellie had never suggested that a man&#x2014;a sort of good-looking, youngish man&#x2014;would appear in her house. For all I knew he could be a burglar.</p><p>&#x201c;I am Ellie&#x2019;s son. Jay Parker.&#x201d; He wore reading glasses, and he peered at me over these like a stern teacher. It was a good look for him. &#x201c;And I didn&#x2019;t expect to find a strange woman dipping into Mom&#x2019;s cash jar while she wasn&#x2019;t in the house.&#x201d;</p><p>A little bead of perspiration worked its way down my back. &#x201c;First of all, I am not a strange woman. In any sense. Ellie and I are friends, and I&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>I what? What could I tell him? My little covered-dish business was an under-the-table operation, and the people who ordered my food wanted it to appear that they had made it themselves. That, and the deliciousness of my cooking, was what they paid me for. &#x201c;I did a job for her, and she told me to take payment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that so?&#x201d; He leaned against the door frame, a man with all the time in the world. All he needed was a piece of hay to chew on. &#x201c;And what <i>job</i> did you do for her?&#x201d; He clearly didn&#x2019;t believe me. With a pang I realized that this man thought I was a thief.</p><p>&#x201c;I mowed her lawn,&#x201d; I blurted. We both turned to look out the window at Ellie&#x2019;s remarkably high grass. &#x201c;Wow. That really was not a good choice,&#x201d; I murmured.</p><p>Now his face grew alert, wary, as though he were ready to employ some sort of martial art if necessary. I may as well have been facing a cop. &#x201c;What exactly is your relationship to my mother? And how did you even get in here, if my mom isn&#x2019;t home?&#x201d;</p><p>At least I could tell the truth about that. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Lilah Drake. Ellie left the door unlocked for me because she was expecting me. As I said, we are friends.&#x201d;</p><p>This did not please him. &#x201c;I think she was actually expecting <i>me</i>,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;So you could potentially have just gotten lucky when you tried the doorknob.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh my God!&#x201d; My face felt hot with embarrassment. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not stealing Ellie&#x2019;s money. She and I have an&#x2014;arrangement. I can&#x2019;t actually discuss it with you. Maybe if you asked your mother&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d; Ellie was creative; she could come up with a good lie for her son, and he&#x2019;d <i>have</i> to believe her.</p><p>There was a silence, as though he were weighing evidence. It felt condescending and weirdly terrifying. &#x201c;Listen, I have to get going. My dog is waiting&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>He brightened for the first time. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s your dog, huh? I figured. He&#x2019;s pretty awesome. What is he, a chocolate Lab?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, he is.&#x201d; I shifted on my feet, not sure how to extricate myself from the situation. My brother said I had a knack for getting into weird predicaments.</p><p>I sighed, and he said, &#x201c;So what do we do now?&#x201d; He patted his shirt pocket, as though looking for a pack of cigarettes, then grimaced and produced a piece of gum. He unwrapped it while still watching me. His glasses had slid down even farther on his nose, and I felt like plucking them off. He popped the gum into his mouth and took off the glasses himself, then beamed a blue gaze at me. Wow. &#x201c;How about if we just wait here together and see what my mom has to say? She&#x2019;s probably out back in the garden, picking pumpkins or harvesting the last of her tomatoes.&#x201d;</p><p>I put the money on Ellie&#x2019;s table. &#x201c;You know what? Ellie can pay me later. I won&#x2019;t have you&#x2014;casting aspersions on my character.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fancy words,&#x201d; said Ellie&#x2019;s son. He moved a little closer to me, until I could smell spearmint on his breath. &#x201c;I still think you should hang around.&#x201d;</p><p>I put my hands on my hips, the way my mother used to do when Cam or I forgot to do the dishes. &#x201c;I have things to do. Please tell Ellie I said hello.&#x201d;</p><p>I whisked past him, out to my car, where Mick sat waiting, a picture of patience. I climbed in and started confiding. &#x201c;Do you believe that guy? Now I&#x2019;m going to have to come back here later to get paid. I don&#x2019;t have time for this, Mick!&#x201d;</p><p>Mick nodded with what seemed like sympathy.</p><p>I reversed out of Ellie&#x2019;s driveway, still fuming. But halfway home, encouraged by Mick&#x2019;s stolid support, and enjoying the <i>Mary Poppins</i> sound track in my CD player, I calmed down slightly. These things could happen in the business world, I told myself. There was no need to give another thought to tall Jay Parker and his accusations and his blue eyes.</p><p>I began to sing along with the music, assuring Mick melodically that I would find the perfect nanny. Something in the look he gave me made me respond aloud. &#x201c;And another thing. I&#x2019;m a grown woman. I&#x2019;m twenty-seven years old, Mick. I don&#x2019;t need some condescending man treating me like a child. Am I right?&#x201d;</p><p>Mick was distracted by a Chihuahua on the sidewalk, so I didn&#x2019;t get a nod.</p><p>&#x201c;Huh. She&#x2019;s pretty cute, right?&#x201d;</p><p>No response. I sighed and went back to my singing, flicking forward on the CD and testing my upper range with &#x201c;Feed the Birds.&#x201d; I started squeaking by the time I reached the middle. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s tricky, Mick. It starts low, and then you get nailed on the refrain. We can&#x2019;t all be Julie Andrews.&#x201d; Mick&#x2019;s expression was benevolent.</p><p>I drove to Caldwell Street and St. Bartholomew Church, where I headed to the back parking lot behind the rectory. I took out my phone and texted I&#x2019;m here to Pet Grandy, a member of St. Bart&#x2019;s Altar and Rosary Guild, a scion of the church, and a go-to person for church social events. Pet was popular, and she had a burning desire to be all things to all people. This included her wish to make food for every church event&#x2014;good food that earned her praise and adulation. Since Pet was actually a terrible cook, I was the answer to her prayers. I had made a lot of money off Pet Grandy in the last year.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be out here within thirty seconds,&#x201d; I told Mick, and sure enough, he had barely started nodding before Pet burst out of the back door of the church social hall and made a beeline for the adjoining rectory lot. Pet&#x2019;s full name was Perpetua; her mother had named her for some nun who had once taught at the parish school. Pet basically lived at the church; she was always running one event or another, and Father Schmidt was her gangly other half. They made a hilarious duo: he, tall and thin in his priestly black, and she, short and plump as a tomato and sporting one of her many velour sweat suits&#x2014;often in offensively bright colors. In fall, you could often spot them tending to the autumnal flower beds outside St. Bart&#x2019;s. At Christmastime, one of them would hold the ladder while the other swayed in front of the giant pine outside the church, clutching strings of white Christmas lights. Pet was utterly devoted to Father Schmidt; they were like a platonic married couple.</p><p>As she marched toward my car, I studied her. Today&#x2019;s ensemble, also velour, was a bright orange number that made her look like a calendar-appropriate pumpkin. Her cheeks were rosy in the cold, and her dark silver-flecked hair was cut short and no-nonsense. Pet was not a frilly person.</p><p>She approached my vehicle, as always, with an almost sinister expression, as if she were buying drugs. Pet was very careful that no one should know what we were doing or why. On the rare occasions that someone witnessed the food handoff, Pet pretended that I was just driving it over from her house. Today she had ordered a huge Crock-Pot full of chili for the bingo event in the church hall. Everyone was bringing food, but Pet&#x2019;s (my) chili had become a favorite.</p><p>I rolled down my window, and Pet looked both ways before leaning in. Her eyes darted constantly, like those of someone marked for assassination. &#x201c;Hello, Lilah. Is it light enough for me to carry?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s pretty heavy, Pet. Do you want me to&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, no. I have a dolly in the vestibule. I&#x2019;ll just run and get it. Here&#x2019;s the money.&#x201d; She thrust an envelope through the window at me with her left hand, her body turned sideways and her right hand scratching her face in an attempt to look casual. Pet was so practiced at clandestine maneuvers that I thought she might actually make a good criminal. I watched her rapid-walk back to the church and marveled that she wasn&#x2019;t thin as a reed, since she was always moving. Pet, however, had the Achilles&#x2019; heel of a sweet addiction: she loved it all, she had told me once. Donuts, cookies, cake, pie, ice cream. &#x201c;I probably have sweets three times a day. My doctor told me I&#x2019;m lucky I don&#x2019;t have diabetes. But I crave it all the time!&#x201d;</p><p>Pet reappeared and I pretended that I was about to get out of my car to help her. I did this every time, just to tease her, and every time she took the bait. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; she shouted, her hand up as though to ward off a bullet aimed at her heart. &#x201c;Stay there! Someone might see you!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, Pet.&#x201d; She opened my back hatch and I spoke to her over my shoulder. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the big Crock-Pot there. Ignore the box in the corner&#x2014;that&#x2019;s for someone else.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine, fine. Thank you, Lilah. I&#x2019;m sure it will be delicious, as always.&#x201d; She hauled it out of the car, grunting slightly, and placed it on her dolly. Then, loudly, for whatever sprites might be listening, she said, &#x201c;Thank you so much for driving this from my house! It&#x2019;s a real time-saver!&#x201d;</p><p>I rolled my eyes at Mick, and he nodded. Mick totally gets it.</p><p>I waved to Pet, who ignored me, and drove away while she was still wheeling her prize back to the church hall. My mother played bingo there sometimes and probably would tonight. We were church members, but we were neither as devout nor as involved as was Pet. My mother called us &#x201c;lapsed Catholics,&#x201d; and said we would probably have to wait at the back of the line on our way to heaven, at which point my father would snort and say that he could name five perfect Catholics who were having affairs.</p><p>Then they would launch into one of their marital spats and I would tune them out or escape to my own home, which was where I headed now.</p><p>My parents are Realtors, and I work for them during the day. I mostly either answer phones at the office or sit at showings, dreaming of recipes while answering questions about hardwood floors, modernized baths, and stainless steel kitchens. It isn&#x2019;t a difficult task, but I do lust after those kitchens more than is healthy. I have visions of starting my own catering business, experimenting with spices at one of those amazing marble islands while a tall blue-eyed man occasionally wanders in to taste my concoctions.</p><p>Mick was staring at the side of my face with his intense look. I slapped my forehead. &#x201c;Oh, buddy! I never gave you your treat, and you had to sit and smell that chili all through the ride!&#x201d;</p><p>Mick nodded.</p><p>We pulled into the long driveway that led to our little house, which was actually an old caretaker&#x2019;s cottage behind a much larger residence. My parents had found it for me and gotten me a crazy deal on rent because they had sold the main house to Terry Randall, a rich eccentric who had taken a liking to my parents during the negotiations. Taking advantage of that, my parents had mentioned that their daughter would love to rent a cottage like the one behind his house, and Terry had agreed. My rent, which Terry didn&#x2019;t need but which my parents had insisted upon, was a steal. I&#x2019;d been in the cottage for more than two years, and Terry and I had become good friends. I was often invited into the big house for the lavish parties that Terry and his girlfriend liked to throw on a regular basis.</p><p>I pulled a Tupperware container out of my tote bag&#x2014;Mick&#x2019;s reward whenever he accompanied me on trips. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s my special boy?&#x201d; I asked him as I popped off the lid.</p><p>Mick started munching, his expression forgiving. He made quick work of the chili inside; I laughed and snapped his picture on my phone. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s going on the refrigerator, boy,&#x201d; I said. It was true, I doted on Mick as if he were my child, but in my defense, Mick was a spectacular dog.</p><p>I belted out a few lines of &#x201c;Jolly Holiday&#x201d; before turning off the sound system and retrieving Mick&#x2019;s now-clean container. I checked my phone and found two text messages: one from my friend Jenny, who wanted me to come for dinner soon, and one from my brother, who wanted me to meet his girlfriend. I&#x2019;d met lots of Cam&#x2019;s girlfriends over time, but this one was special to him, I could tell, because she was Italian. My brother and I, thanks to a wonderfully enthusiastic junior high Italian teacher, had developed a mutual love of Italian culture before we even got to high school. We immersed ourselves in Italian art, music, sports, and film. We both took Italian in high school, and Cam went on to get his PhD in Italian, which he now taught at Loyola, my alma mater. We were Italophiles from way back, but Cam had never met an Italian woman. It was I who had won the distinction of dating an Italian first, and tha...</p></p><h2>What Wives Wish Their Husbands Knew About Women</h2><p>Dr. Dobson&#39;s suggestions for marital happiness are interesting, practical, and humorous.</p><p><b>James C.

Katriona, a young fairy, kidnaps the princess in order to save her; she and her aunt raise the child in their small village, where no one knows her true identity. But Pernicia is looking for her, intent on revenge for a defeat four hundred years old. Robin McKinley&#39;s masterful version of Sleeping Beauty is, like all of her work, a remarkable literary feat.</p><p>Renowned fantasy writer Robin McKinley, author of the lush "Beauty and the Beast" retellings <i>Beauty</i> and <i>Rose Daughter</i>, has produced another re-mastered fairy tale, this time about the dreamy Sleeping Beauty. Much like in the original story, the infant princess, here named Rosie, is cursed by an evil fairy to die on her 21st birthday by pricking her finger on a spindle. That same day, Rosie is whisked away into hiding by a peasant fairy who raises her and conceals her royal identity. From that point on, McKinley's plot and characterization become wildly inventive. She imagines Rosie growing up into a strapping young woman who despises her golden hair, prefers leather breeches to ball gowns, and can communicate with animals. And on that fateful birthday, with no help from a prince, Rosie saves herself and her entire sleeping village from destruction, although she pays a realistic price. In a final master stroke, McKinley cleverly takes creative license when the spell-breaking kiss (made famous in "Sleeping Beauty") comes from a surprising source and is bestowed upon the character least expected.<p> Although the entire novel is well written, McKinley's characterization of Rosie's animal friends is exceptionally fine. Observations such as "...foxes generally wanted to talk about butterflies and grasses and weather for a long time while they sized you up," will spark reader's imaginations. It won't be hard to persuade readers of any age to become lost in this marvelous tale; the difficult part will be convincing them to come back from McKinley's country, where "the magic... was so thick and tenacious that it settled over the land like chalk dust...." Highly recommended.

Her art addressed issues that resonate today, such as sexual violence and women&#x2019;s problematic relationship to political power. Her powerful paintings with vigorous female protagonists chime with modern audiences, and she is celebrated by feminist critics and scholars.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book breaks new ground by placing Gentileschi in the context of women&#x2019;s political history. Mary D. Garrard, noted Gentileschi scholar, shows that the artist most likely knew or knew about contemporary writers such as the Venetian feminists Lucrezia Marinella and Arcangela Tarabotti. She discusses recently discovered paintings, offers fresh perspectives on known works, and examines the artist anew in the context of feminist history. This beautifully illustrated book gives for the first time a full portrait of a strong woman artist who fought back through her art.</p><p><b>Mary D. Garrard </b>is professor emerita of art history at American University in Washington, DC.

Eph 6: 14-16). In this way they will be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks them the reason of their hope, with meekness and fear (cf. 1 Peter 3: 15-16).-Bishop Athanasius Schneider, from the ForewordFor the first time, St. Robert Bellarmine&#x2019;s long Catechism, written in the form of a dialogue, has been made available in the English Language.This Catechism was composed by St. Robert Bellarmine in 1598 and received Papal approbation from several Popes, most notably Pope Clement VIII and one of the greatest theologians to ever sit on the throne of St. Peter, Pope Benedict XIV. It was translated into Latin for use throughout the Church and has run through a number of editions throughout the centuries. Being written as a dialogue, it goes beyond the rote memorization of other catechisms (including that of Baltimore) by giving a deep explanation of the teachings of the faith with comparisons and parables.What is wholesome about this Catechism is not only the soundness of its doctrine, but the warmth that a great theologian that was accustomed to dealing with complicated matters of theology descends to lovingly explain the basic truths of faith in a manner that average laity can easily understand. It is not for nothing that St. Robert was made the Patron of all Catechists!</p><p></p><h2>Your Body and the Stars: The Zodiac As Your Wellness Guide</h2><p>The first book of its kind, <i>Your Body and the Stars</i> is a fun, practical, and insightful handbook that takes a revolutionary approach to holistic wellness by unlocking the powers of the stars.<br><br>Do you suffer from neck pains?

Dispelling many of the myths surrounding the topic, Vaughan Lowe clearly outlines what international law can and cannot do and what it is and what it isn't doing to make the world a better place.

Problematic from the very beginning, even its contemporaries saw the treaty as a mediocre compromise, creating a precarious order in Europe and abroad and destined to fall short of ensuring lasting peace. At the time, observers read the treaty through competing lenses: a desire for peace after five years of disastrous war, demands for vengeance against Germany, the uncertain future of colonialism, and, most alarmingly, the emerging threat of Bolshevism. A century after its signing, we can look back at how those developments evolved through the twentieth century, evaluating the treaty and its consequences with unprecedented depth of perspective.<br><br>The author of several award-winning books, Michael S. Neiberg provides a lucid and authoritative account of the Treaty of Versailles, explaining the enormous challenges facing those who tried to put the world back together after the global destruction of the World War I. Rather than assessing winners and losers, this compelling book analyzes the many subtle factors that influenced the treaty and the dominant, at times ambiguous role of the "Big Four" leaders?Woodrow Wilson of the United States, David Lloyd George of Great Britain, Vittorio Emanuele Orlando of Italy, and Georges Clmenceau of France.<br><br>The Treaty of Versailles was not solely responsible for the catastrophic war that crippled Europe and the world just two decades later, but it played a critical role. As Neiberg reminds us, to understand decolonization, World War II, the Cold War, and even the complex world we inhabit today, there is no better place to begin than with World War I and the treaty that tried, and perhaps failed, to end it.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael S. Neiberg </strong>is the inaugural Chair of War Studies in the Department of National Security and Strategy at the US Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He is the author of many books on the First and Second World Wars, including <em>The Path to War: How the First World War Created Modern</em> <em>America, The Blood of Free Men: The Liberation of Paris, 1944</em>, and <em>Dance of the Furies: Europe and the Outbreak of World War I</em>, which was named one of the five best books ever written about the war by the <em>Wall Street Journal.</em><br>Neiberg steers us illuminatingly through this flawed agreement that would eventually lead to a second world war. * Military History *</p><h2>Introductory Biological Statistics, Fourth Edition</h2><p>A thorough understanding of biology, no matter which subfield, requires a thorough understanding of statistics.

In addition to giving the reader information about observing techniques for meteors, this book also provides a fully detailed account of the types of meteorites, how and where to find them, how to prepare and analyse them. The book provides everything the amateur astronomer (or geologist!) needs to know about meteors and meteorites. It is thus the only complete book on the subject available at present.</p></p><p><p>Imagine the unique experience of being the very first person to hold a newly-found meteorite in your hand &#x2013; a rock from space, older than Earth!</p> <p></p> <p>"Weekend meteorite hunting" with magnets and metal detectors is becoming ever more popular as a pastime, but of course you can&#x2019;t just walk around and pick up meteorites in the same way that you can pick up seashells on the beach. Those fragments that survived the intense heat of re-entry tend to disguise themselves as natural rocks over time, and it takes a trained eye &#x2013; along with the information in this book &#x2013; to recognize them.</p> <p></p> <p>Just as amateur astronomers are familiar with the telescopes and accessories needed to study a celestial object, amateur meteoriticists have to use equipment ranging from simple hand lenses to microscopes to study a specimen, to identify its type and origins.</p> <p></p> <p>Equipment and techniques are covered in detail here of course, along with a complete and fully illustrated guide to what you might find and where you might find it. In fact, the Field Guide to Meteors and Meteorites contains pretty much everything an amateur astronomer &#x2013; or geologist &#x2013; needs to know about meteors and meteorites.</p><p>From the reviews:</p> <p></p> <p>"The average age of most meteorites is 4.6 billion years. ... This groundbreaking book ... is the most concise guide to date on every aspect of this fascinating field. The authors combine the collecting, study and hunting of meteorites with good advice on equipment and identification techniques. ... it is equally suited to beginner and expert with well-illustrated page-by-page descriptions of each meteorite sub-type. ... This is an impressive book containing everything you need to know about these remarkable cosmic treasures." (Mark Ford, BBC Sky at Night, September, 2008)</p> <p>"This practical reference source ... goes beyond the well-illustrated guide to help meteorite hunters identify their prize (with detailed color photos), and includes the astronomical context needed to understand meteorites and their Earth-bound predecessors, meteoroids. ... A mineral glossary and references (print and online) supplement the text. ... Summing Up: Recommended. General audiences and all undergraduate students." (L.R. Johnston, Choice, Vol. 46 (5), January, 2009)</p> <p>"This is a magnificent book and a must for anyone who is interested in our solar system and its formation. ... A wonderful segment is included on what meteorites look like in thin section and it is a glorious world indeed. ... If you do, or if you wish to find you own, or if you just wish to learn more about the environment our Earth inhabits, you will want a copy of this outstanding book."

The rapidly changing educational landscape presents unique challenges and opportunities for addressing diversity both creatively and constructively in schools. <i>Multicultural Education</i> helps current and future educators fully understand sophisticated concepts of culture; become more effective practitioners in diverse classrooms; and view race, class, gender, social class, and exceptionality as intersectional concepts.</p> <p>Now in its tenth edition, this bestselling textbook assists educators to effectively respond to the ways race, social class, and gender interact to influence student behavior and learning. Contributions from leading authorities in multicultural education discuss the effects of class and religion on education; differences in educational opportunities for male, female, and LGBTQ students; and issues surrounding non-native English speakers, students of color, and students with disabilities. Contemporary in relevance, this timely volume promotes multicultural education as a process of school reform. Practical advice helps teachers increase student academic achievement, work effectively with parents, improve classroom assessment, and benefit from diversity.</p></p><p><p><b>Did You Know?</b> </p><p><b>This book is also available as a Wiley eText.</b> </p><p>The Wiley eText is a complete digital version of the text that makes time spent studying more efficient.

Its compact narrative, which encompasses a brutish childhood, an overprotective mother, temporary gender bending, sexual violence, and a final coming to manhood with the promise of future military prowess, may be unparalleled in a single narrative of such brevity. The text has survived in hundreds of manuscripts, sometimes copied with Statius&#x2019; much longer and lugubrious <i>Thebaid</i>, but just as often with other racy short narratives and dramas taught in the medieval schools. The poem&#x2019;s literary playfulness, visual imagery, and lighthearted treatment of mythological and historical data made it&#x2014;and can still make it&#x2014;a goldmine in the classroom. Until now, however, it has been virtually impossible to get a sense of the work if one did not know Latin&#x2014;recent translations notwithstanding. Stanley Lombardo's translation of the <i>Achilleid</i> is a dream: it&#x2019;s sound, enthralling, and will fully engage readers with this enticing, perplexing, at times distressing, but ultimately rewarding work."<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x2014;Marjorie Curry Woods, Blumberg Centennial Professor of English and University Distinguished Teaching Professor, <i>The University of Texas at Austin </i></p></p><p><b>Stanley Lombardo</b> is Emeritus Professor of Classics, University of Kansas.<br><p><b>Peter Heslin</b> is Senior Lecturer in the Department of Classics and Ancient History, Durham University.</p>"The <i>Achilleid</i> has been translated into English twice before in the last twenty years, but neither previous translation addressed the needs of the undergraduate or general reader. Lombardo has not only made the <i>Achilleid</i> truly accessible for the first time to the Latinless reader of English, but has also produced an elegant and witty English poem. . . . Even in this brief text (roughly one thousand lines), Lombardo has the opportunity to demonstrate impressive range. He misses none of Statius's jokes or witty formulations. Where appropriate, however, Lombardo can also offer a higher register that shows the epic's constant negotiation with its 'Very Serious' tradition."<br> &#x2014;Neil Bernstein, <i>Ohio University</i>, in <i>CJ-Online</i><br><br>"A sparkling translation of Statius' fragmentary gem . . . Lombardo plays in the space between Statius' terse, demanding style and the debatable gravity of his epic's tone and subject matter. He locates the<i> Achilleid</i> precisely where he should, in the beguiling presence of simultaneously conflicting and complementary forces. Lombardo's <i>Achilleid</i> is a welcome translation that makes the text available for regular classroom instruction. . . . This is the first stand-alone English&nbsp;translation to be published in recent history. This fact lends the book the sort of pedagogical flexibility that facilitates its inclusion on a syllabus and brings its price down substantially from the cost of its nearest competitor, Shackleton-Bailey's Loeb edition of <i>Thebaid</i> 8&#x2013;12 and <i>Achilleid</i> 1&#x2013;2."<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x2014;Leo Landrey, <i>Fordham University</i>, in <i>BMCR</i><br><br>"Lombardo's translation seems like a perfect addition to any reading course that covers the epic tradition, complicating in a compact manner issues such as heroism, masculinity, and sexual identity and offering a ready-made literary foil the Iliadic Achilles more familiar to our modern imagination.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; "[Heslin's Introduction] ensures that the accompanying poem cannot be read as an incomplete curiosity but rather as an interpretative challenge as worthy as any other in the Latin epic tradition."<br> &#x2014;Patrick J.

Remole, Managing Director, Head of Global Structured Equity, Credit Suisse Asset Management.</p> <p>Mathematically rigorous and meticulously organized, <i>Active Portfolio Management</i> broke new ground when it first became available to investment managers in 1994. By outlining an innovative process to uncover raw signals of asset returns, develop them into refined forecasts, then use those forecasts to construct portfolios of exceptional return and minimal risk, i.e., portfolios that consistently beat the market, this hallmark book helped thousands of investment managers. <i>Active Portfolio Management, Second Edition</i>, now sets the bar even higher. Like its predecessor, this volume details how to apply economics, econometrics, and operations research to solving practical investment problems, and uncovering superior profit opportunities. It outlines an active management framework that begins with a benchmark portfolio, then defines exceptional returns as they relate to that benchmark. Beyond the comprehensive treatment of the active management process covered previously, this new edition expands to cover asset allocation, long/short investing, information horizons, and other topics relevant today. It revisits a number of discussions from the first edition, shedding new light on some of today's most pressing issues, including risk, dispersion, market impact, and performance analysis, while providing empirical evidence where appropriate. The result is an updated, comprehensive set of strategic concepts and rules of thumb for guiding the process of-and increasing the profits from-active investment management.</p></p><p><p><b>Richard C.

In Europe, they go mad for them! They call it "the 8th Art." Every year, a thriving international festival takes place at Angoulome (France) to celebrate graphic novels, a popular art form as well respected as any literary genre. In fact, there are all kinds of BD for both adults and children. They are available everywhere from the village bookshop to the supermarket via cultural media stores like La FNAC or Virgin. My personal love of BD was kindled while living in France. However, it wasn't until the birth of my first son in 1988 that I saw any need to translate and publish them. The struggle of translating them for every bedtime story told me that there had to be an easier way! So, from a desire to have a ready and plentiful supply of these wonderful books available in English, Glo'worm was eventually born in early 1998. Conscious that the English reading public at large was not properly aware of BD, and out of admiration for the work of Goscinny (the author of <i>Asterix</i>), I decided to start with another of his characters: Lucky Luke. Lucky Luke is this super cool cowboy who, with his wisecracking horse Jolly Jumper, protects the population West of the Mississippi from the exaction of all kinds of villains, some real (The Daltons, Jesse James) and some invented. The stories, always well researched, combine fact, fiction and humorous send off with a refreshing lack of political correctness. So far, we have published four titles - <i>Calamity Jane</i>, <i>Jesse James</i>, <i>Dalton City</i> and <i>The Tenderfoot</i>. In total, there are over 60 Lucky Luke titles. An amazing success story worldwide for the last 50 years, there are 250 million Lucky Luke books in print in over 26 languages worldwide. From my own research, the ecstatic response to the BD by my children and their friends proved beyond any doubt that these books deserve to be read by English speakers and that English speaking children deserve the opportunity to read them. Glo'worm sets out to give them this opportunity.The character of Lucky Luke became a myth thanks to Morris (his creator) and Goscinny. These two giants of the 9th art collaborated with passion for more than 20 years until the death of the famous scriptwriter. Goscinny is the author of the well-known Ast�rix, which he launched with Uderzo. He also co-authored Iznogoud with Tabary. In 1992, Morris received the &#39;Grand Prix Sp�cial 20�me Anniversaire&#39; from the international comics show at Angoul�me, and in 1998, the French Minister of Culture decorated him with the rank of &#39;Officier des Arts et des Lettres&#39;.</p><h2>Ouch!

To his son, waiting patiently in the car while his father peddles beauty wares and quickies to lonely housewives in the south of England, Bunny is a hero, larger than life. But Bunny himself, haunted by what might be his wife's ghost, seems only dimly aware of his son's existence.</p><p>When his bizarre trip shades into a final reckoning, when he can no longer be sure what is real and what is not, Bunny finally begins to recognize the love he feels for his son. And he sees that the revenants of his world&#x2015;decrepit fathers, vengeful ghosts, jealous husbands, and horned psycho-killers&#x2015;are lurking in the shadows, waiting to exact their toll.</p><p>At turns dark and humane, <i>The Death of Bunny Munro </i>is a tender portrait of the relationship between a boy and his father, with all the wit and enigma that fans will recognize as Nick Cave's singular vision.</p></p><p><p>Nick Cave has been performing music for more than thirty years as the lead singer of the Birthday Party, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, and Grinderman. He has collaborated with Kylie Minogue, PJ Harvey, and many others. His first novel, <i>And the Ass Saw the Angel</i>, was published in 1989. Born in Australia, Cave now lives near Brighton, England.</p>The Death of Bunny Munro &nbsp;1 <p>I am damned, thinks Bunny Munro in a sudden moment of self-awareness reserved for those who are soon to die. He feels that somewhere down the line he has made a grave mistake, but this realisation passes in a dreadful heartbeat, and is gone &#x2013; leaving him in a room at the Grenville Hotel, in his underwear, with nothing but himself and his appetites. He closes his eyes and pictures a random vagina, then sits on the edge of the hotel bed and, in slow motion, leans back against the quilted headboard. He clamps the mobile phone under his chin and with his teeth breaks the seal on a miniature bottle of brandy. He empties the bottle down his throat, lobs it across the room, then shudders and gags and says into the phone, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t worry, love, everything&#x2019;s going to be all right.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m scared, Bunny,&#x2019; says his wife, Libby.</p><p>&#x2018;What are you scared of? You got nothing to be scared of.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Everything, I&#x2019;m scared of everything,&#x2019; she says.</p><p>But Bunny realises that something has changed in his wife&#x2019;s voice, the soft cellos have gone and a high, rasping violin has been added, played by an escaped ape or something. He registers it but has yet to understand exactly what this means.</p><p>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t talk like that. You know that gets you nowhere,&#x2019; says Bunny, and like an act of love he sucks deep on a Lambert &amp; Butler. It is in that instant that it hits him &#x2013; the baboon on the violin, the inconsolable downward spiral of her drift &#x2013; and he says, &#x2018;Fuck!&#x2019; and blows two furious tusks of smoke from his nostrils.</p><p>&#x2018;Are you off your Tegretol? Libby, tell me you&#x2019;ve been taking your Tegretol!&#x2019;</p><p>There is silence on the other end of the line, then a broken, faraway sob.</p><p>&#x2018;Your father called again. I don&#x2019;t know what to say to him. I don&#x2019;t know what he wants. He shouts at me. He raves,&#x2019; she says.</p><p>&#x2018;For Christ&#x2019;s sake, Libby, you know what the doctor said. If you don&#x2019;t take your Tegretol, you get depressed. As you well know, it&#x2019;s dangerous for you to get depressed. How many fucking times do we have to go through this?&#x2019;</p><p>The sob doubles on itself, then doubles again, till it becomes gentle, wretched crying and it reminds Bunny of their first night together &#x2013; Libby lying in his arms, in the throes of some inexplicable crying jag, in a down-at-heel hotel room in Eastbourne. He remembers her looking up at him and saying, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry, I get a little emotional sometimes,&#x2019; or something like that, and Bunny pushes the heel of his hand into his crotch and squeezes, releasing a pulse of pleasure into his lower spine.</p><p>&#x2018;Just take the fucking Tegretol,&#x2019; he says, softening.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m scared, Bun. There&#x2019;s this guy running around attacking women.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What guy?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;He paints his face red and wears plastic devil&#x2019;s horns.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Up north. It&#x2019;s on the telly.&#x2019;</p><p>Bunny picks up the remote off the bedside table and with a series of parries and ripostes turns on the television set that sits on top of the mini-bar. With the mute button on, he moves through the channels till he finds some black-and-white CCTV footage taken at a shopping mall in Newcastle. A man, bare-chested and wearing tracksuit bottoms, weaves through a crowd of terrified shoppers. His mouth is open in a soundless scream. He appears to be wearing devil&#x2019;s horns and waves what looks like a big black stick.</p><p>Bunny curses under his breath and in that moment all energy, sexual or otherwise, deserts him. He thrusts the remote at the TV and in a fizz of static it goes out and Bunny lets his head loll back. He focuses on a water stain on the ceiling shaped like a small bell or a woman&#x2019;s breast.</p><p>Somewhere in the outer reaches of his consciousness he becomes aware of a manic twittering sound, a tinnitus of enraged protest, electronic sounding and horrible, but Bunny does not recognise this, rather he hears his wife say, &#x2018;Bunny? Are you there?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Libby. Where are you?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;In bed.&#x2019;</p><p>Bunny looks at his watch, trombones his hand, but cannot focus.</p><p>&#x2018;For Christ&#x2019;s sake. Where is Bunny Junior?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;In his room, I guess.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Look, Libby, if my dad calls again .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;He carries a trident,&#x2019; says his wife.</p><p>&#x2018;What?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;A garden fork.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What? Who?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The guy, up north.&#x2019;</p><p>Bunny realises then that the screaming, cheeping sound is coming from outside. He hears it now above the bombination of the air conditioner and it is sufficiently apocalyptic to almost arouse his curiosity. But not quite.</p><p>The watermark on the ceiling is growing, changing shape &#x2013; a bigger breast, a buttock, a sexy female knee &#x2013; and a droplet forms, elongates and trembles, detaches itself from the ceiling, freefalls and explodes on Bunny&#x2019;s chest. Bunny pats at it as if he were in a dream and says, &#x2018;Libby, baby, where do we live?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Brighton.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;And where is Brighton?&#x2019; he says, running a finger along the row of miniature bottles of liquor arranged on the bedside table and choosing a Smirnoff.</p><p>&#x2018;Down south.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Which is about as far away from &#x201c;up north&#x201d; as you can get without falling into the bloody sea. Now, sweetie, turn off the TV, take your Tegretol, take a sleeping tablet &#x2013; shit, take two sleeping tablets &#x2013; and I&#x2019;ll be back tomorrow. Early.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The pier is burning down,&#x2019; says Libby.</p><p>&#x2018;What?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The West Pier, it&#x2019;s burning down. I can smell the smoke from here.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The West Pier?&#x2019;</p><p>Bunny empties the tiny bottle of vodka down his throat, lights another cigarette and rises from the bed. The room heaves as Bunny is hit by the realisation that he is very drunk. With arms held out to the side and on tiptoe, Bunny moonwalks across the room to the window. He lurches, stumbles and Tarzans the faded chintz curtains until he finds his balance and steadies himself. He draws them open extravagantly and vulcanised daylight and the screaming of birds deranges the room. Bunny&#x2019;s pupils contract painfully as he grimaces through the window, into the light. He sees a dark cloud of starlings, twittering madly over the flaming, smoking hulk of the West Pier which stands, helpless, in the sea across from the hotel. He wonders why he hadn&#x2019;t seen this before and then wonders how long he has been in this room, then remembers his wife and hears her say, &#x2018;Bunny, are you there?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah,&#x2019; says Bunny, transfixed by the sight of the burning pier and the thousand screaming birds.</p><p>&#x2018;The starlings have gone mad. It&#x2019;s such a horrible thing. Their little babies burning in their nests. I can&#x2019;t bear it, Bun,&#x2019; says Libby, the high violin rising.</p><p>Bunny moves back to the bed and can hear his wife crying on the end of the phone. Ten years, he thinks, ten years and those tears still get him &#x2013; those turquoise eyes, that joyful pussy, ah man, and that unfathomable sob stuff &#x2013; and he lies back against the headboard and bats, ape-like, at his genitals and says, &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll be back tomorrow, babe, early.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Do you love me, Bun?&#x2019; says Libby.</p><p>&#x2018;You know I do.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Do you swear on your life?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Upon Christ and all his saints. Right down to your little shoes, baby.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Can&#x2019;t you get home tonight?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I would if I could,&#x2019; says Bunny, groping around on the bed for his cigarettes, &#x2018;but I&#x2019;m miles away.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oh, Bunny .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you fucking liar .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x2019;</p><p>The line goes dead and Bunny says, &#x2018;Libby? Lib?&#x2019;</p><p>He looks inexplicably at the phone as if he has just discovered he is holding it, then clamshells it shut as another droplet of water explodes on his chest. Bunny forms a little &#x2018;O&#x2019; with his mouth and he shoves a cigarette in it. He torches it with his Zippo and pulls deeply, then emits a considered stream of grey smoke.</p><p>&#x2018;You got your hands full there, darling.&#x2019;</p><p>With great effort Bunny turns his head and looks at the prostitute standing in the bathroom doorway. Her fluorescent pink knickers pulse against her chocolate-coloured skin. She scratches at her cornrows and a slice of orange flesh peeps behind her drug-slack lower lip. Bunny thinks that her nipples look like the triggers on those mines they floated in the sea to blow up ships in the war or something, and almost tells her this, but forgets and draws on his cigarette again and says, &#x2018;That was my wife. She suffers from depression.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;She&#x2019;s not alone there, sweetheart,&#x2019; she says as she jitters across the faded Axminster carpet, the shocking tip of her tongue protruding pinkly from between her lips. She drops to her knees and takes Bunny&#x2019;s cock in her mouth.</p><p>&#x2018;No, it&#x2019;s a medical condition. She&#x2019;s on medication.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Her and me both, darling,&#x2019; says the girl, across Bunny&#x2019;s stomach.</p><p>Bunny seems to give this reply due consideration as he manoeuvres his hips. A limp black hand rests on his belly, and looking down Bunny sees that each fingernail has the detailed representation of a tropical sunset painted on it.</p><p>&#x2018;Sometimes it gets really bad,&#x2019; he says.</p><p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s why they call it the blues, baby,&#x2019; she says, but Bunny barely hears this as her voice comes out in a low, incomprehensible croak. The hand twitches and then jumps on his stomach.</p><p>&#x2018;Hey? What?&#x2019; he says,...</p></p><h2>Storming the Court: How a Band of Law Students Fought the President--and Won</h2><p>In 1992, three hundred innocent Haitian men, women, and children who had qualified for political asylum in the United States were detained at Guant�namo Bay, Cuba -- and told they might never be freed. Charismatic democracy activist Yvonne Pascal and her fellow refugees had no contact with the outside world, no lawyers, and no hope . . . until a group of inspired Yale Law School students vowed to free them. <br> <br> Pitting the students and their untested professor Harold Koh against Kenneth Starr, the Justice Department, the Pentagon, and Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, this real-life legal thriller takes the reader from the halls of Yale and the federal courts of New York to the slums of Port-au-Prince and the windswept hills of Guant�namo Bay and ultimately to the U.S. Supreme Court. Written with grace and passion, <i>Storming the Court</i> captures the emotional highs and despairing lows of a legal education like no other -- a high-stakes courtroom campaign against the White House in the name of the greatest of American values: freedom.</p><p><b>Brandt Goldstein</b>, a 1992 graduate of Yale Law School, has written for <i>The New York Times Magazine, The Washington Post, Chicago Tribune</i>, and <i>Slate</i>.

There was an explosion of protest in Creole.</p><p>"How do you know?" someone called out.</p><p>"Evans got the word," Antenor replied, his voice echoing off the walls. "There's no way to stop it now. <i>Go home!"</i></p><p>The shouting continued, but people began streaming out. Rumors had been flying through the city for weeks: President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was in trouble. Antenor's warning only confirmed what everyone had feared. </p><p>Yvonne fought her way through the crowd to her husband. He pulled her aside.</p><p>"Tonight, tomorrow," he said. "No one knows for sure. But it's coming."</p><p>Her chest felt tight. She had to get home, find the children. </p><p>"Don't go outside," he said. "Whatever you do."</p><p>"What about you? Where will you be?"</p><p>"I may not see you for a while," he whispered, holding her close. Everyone at the meeting was in danger, but as a key figure in KID -- the Confederation for Democratic Unity -- Antenor would now be a hunted man.</p><p>He hurried Yvonne outside, his arm around her. Downtown Port-au-Prince was a circus of hawkers and hustlers, the street choked with dented pickup trucks and <i>tap-tap</i> buses in frantic colors. Horns blared and thick blue exhaust clouded the air. Antenor signaled for a taxi, something they could not really afford. Several motored by -- beat-up Toyotas and Hondas jammed with passengers -- and he finally broke into a run, flagging one down at a clogged intersection. Yvonne squeezed in, and as the car pulled away, she watched her husband stride back toward the courtyard.</p><p>The cab careened around open-air markets and abandoned construction projects, then descended into Cite Soleil, a labyrinth of tin shanties and open sewers. Yvonne paid the driver and scurried down a muddy pathway. Shriveled men were hunched over dominoes. Bare-chested children in rags kicked at an empty plastic jug. Dogs scavenged through garbage, their ribs straining against sagging flesh.</p><p>She reached her three-room shanty, breathless. Her mother, Therese, was cooking rice and beans over a charcoal fire. Her six-year-old son, Jacques, sat on the floor, copying his name on a scrap of paper. Yvonne gave the boy a relieved kiss, then ran out to retrieve her eleven-year-old, Daniel, who was playing soccer in the nearby dirt churchyard. He didn't want to leave, but she dragged him home.</p><p>With both kids inside, Yvonne ventured out to warn the neighborhood about the coup. There was little need. People already knew. She could feel it around her -- a hard, dark fear. Young men were stockpiling machetes and rakes, shovels and old planks of wood, anything that might serve as a weapon. She grabbed someone's arm. You can't fight bullets with a stick, she argued. They had to resist, the man said. If enough people went to the palace, they could stop the military.</p><p>She shook her head. This was sheer stupidity. We have to stay alive for tomorrow! she cried. But they wouldn't listen. Resigned, she used the fading daylight to fill extra jars with water at the public stone fountain. It would be too dangerous to go out after dark.</p><p>Through the evening and all the next day, Yvonne and her family waited, tense, uncertain. Other local organizers rapped on the door, slipped in to talk with her. The <i>teledy�l</i> -- rumor mill -- was churning. But there were no soldiers around. It was strangely quiet. </p><p>And then, as darkness fell, gunfire erupted.</p><p>Yvonne raced into a bedroom with the boys and yanked them to the floor, shielding their bodies with her own. Bullets ricocheted off the corrugated metal roof with a loud <i>pang-pang-pang.</i> There was shouting, punctured by more gunshots. Screams and cries followed, and her children broke into sobs. She crouched over them, singing, raising her voice whenever the guns grew loud. It went on all night, the air laced with the acrid smell of burning tires from protest barricades. Well after sunrise, her children finally collapsed into sleep. </p><p>Later, the news crackled over her father's transistor radio on Radio Soleil: Aristide had been forced out of the country. She slumped in despair. Everything she and Antenor had worked for -- Aristide's election, a new beginning, a country where her children could have hope -- was gone. Yvonne lay low with her family for several days, worrying, brooding. Finally, with the gunfire growing sporadic and distant, she stole outside to investigate. Clumps of melted tires smoldered in the alleys. Bodies lay in pools of blood, flies buzzing around them, dogs tugging at their limbs. A heavy truck rumbled by on the main road. Her neighbor passed on the rumor: the coup leaders had ordered the dead dumped in Titanyen, the paupers' graveyard north of the capital.</p><p>Darting through the shadows, shanty to shanty, Yvonne made her way to the nearby pawnshop. She gave the owner a gourde, about twenty cents, to use the telephone. There was no answer at the KID office. She dialed the number again and again with no luck. Fearing the worst, she finally risked a visit to another KID member in a neighboring slum. Antenor, he reassured her, was safe. He'd gone into hiding in the Carrefour-Feuilles section of town, a poor hillside quarter overlooking the Port-au-Prince Bay. But KID's headquarters had been ransacked and the group's leader, Port-au-Prince mayor Evans Paul, had been arrested and beaten at the airport.</p><p>Yvonne steeled herself. While she did not have her husband's public profile, she was a known activist in Cite Soleil, which put her in serious danger. Graver still, authorities would see her as a means to track down Antenor. She got home as fast as she could, and with soldiers prowling the streets, she kept to the shanty, her children beside her.</p><p>Several weeks later, her husband remained in hiding; Aristide was still out of the country; and Cite Soleil had plunged into a state of constant terror. Every day now, people in Yvonne's neighborhood were slipping away. She knew some were bound for the countryside, seeking refuge with friends or relatives. But others were headed for the coastal areas -- the beaches near Cap-Ha�tien; the island of La Gon�ve -- where the boats lay waiting.</p><p><i>New Haven, September 4, 1991.</i></p><p>A sturdy Asian man shuffled into class with an overstuffed leather briefcase and a Lands' End canvas bag bursting with papers. He wore a navy blue blazer, and his stick-straight hair framed an open, fleshy face. He broke into a big grin.</p><p>"Hi, hi. I'm Harold Koh," he said in a guttural buzz. "Welcome to Yale Law School."</p><p>Koh greeted several students by name. They glanced around, wondering how he knew who they were.</p><p>"You've all got four classes this semester: constitutional law, torts, contracts -- and the one that really matters." Koh thrust his index finger in the air and his eyes lit up.</p><p>"This one! Procedure!"</p><p>Tory Clawson, a lanky first year in Birkenstocks, laughed along with everyone else. Nothing seemed to have gone right during her first day, but she'd heard that Koh's class was something special.</p><p>"Civil procedure is the ball game!" Koh shouted. "The ball game. Everything comes down to procedure. Does everyone understand this?" He paused as if he expected the students to answer.</p><p>"If you don't know procedure, nothing else matters. Contracts. You can have the most airtight contract claim in the world. You don't know how to file a complaint, you're out of luck. Torts. Someone can run over you with a tractor while a TV news crew films it. You don't understand how to take discovery, you'll never get the videotape!"</p><p>More laughter. Koh took off his coat and paced back and forth, limping slightly on his right leg.</p><p>"Procedure. Procedure. Everything," he said in a self-mocking tone, "comes down to procedure."</p><p>Koh went to the blackboard. Papers rustled on the desks as Tory and the other students reached for their pens.</p><p>In small capital letters, in the upper right-hand corner of the board, he wrote: 1. BIPOLAR &amp; ADVERSARIAL.</p><p>"What's the essence of a lawsuit in our system?" he asked, eyebrows raised. No one answered.</p><p>"In a civil system like they have in France, everyone cooperates in a search for truth. The parties work together to figure out what happened and how to make sure justice is done. But what do we do here in America? What do we do?"</p><p>He made a fist and shook it.</p><p>"Fight?" someone offered.</p><p>"Right! We fight. We fight. Our system is bipolar: two parties. And it's adversarial. <i>Roe versus Wade. Brown versus Board. Marbury versus Madison."</i></p><p>Tory scribbled quickly.</p><p>Koh clenched both fists and held them out. "Let's say there's a disagreement between two parties. They start here." He set his fists a few inches apart, indicating the extent of the dispute.</p><p>"But when they go to court, they don't cooperate. They each take a harder line. They stake out positions here" -- he moved one fist far to his right -- "and over here" -- and the other fist far to his left.</p><p>"Then pow!" He slammed his fists together. "They collide! And through this adversarial system, through this fight, what do we expect to happen?"</p><p>He paused for a moment, waiting for an answer. </p><p>"We expect the truth to emerge, right? Justice to be done. Right?"</p><p>Tory had come to Yale hoping to get involved in human rights work, though she wasn't quite sure what lawyers in that area actually did. The idea had seized her during a stint volunteering in Nepal, where she'd witnessed the country's 1990 democratic revolution firsthand. After marching with hundreds of thousands through Kathmandu's dusty streets, she dashed for cover as the soldiers opened fire. Terrified, she watched as the crowds sprinted off barefoot, leaving behind crumpled bodie...</p></p><h2>KING of GLORY: The Bible's Story &amp; Message in 70 Scenes</h2><p>History&#x2019;s original story of romance and rescue, as recorded in the Bible, is distilled into 70 scenes with simple but not superficial text alongside bright and bold paintings.

God did not design the church to be a two-hour experience on Sunday but a mixture of people from all across the map and spectrum: men and women, rich and poor, Caucasians or African Americans, and Mexican Americans, Latin Americans, Asian Americans, and Indian Americans, and a mixture of people with varying personalities and tastes.&nbsp; The church McKnight grew up in was a fellowship of sames and likes. There was almost no variety in his church. White folks, same beliefs about everything, same tastes in music and worship and sermons and lifestyle.&nbsp; Because of his experience, he writes incisively and compellingly.</p><p>The church is <em>God&#x2019;s world-changing social experiment</em> of bringing unlikes and differents to the table to share life with one another as a new kind of family.&nbsp; When this happens we show to the world what love, justice, peace, reconciliation, and life together is designed by God to be. The church is God&#x2019;s show-and-tell for the world to see how God wants us to live as a family.</p></p><p><p>Scot McKnight (PhD, Nottingham) is the Julius R.

He is the author of more than fifty books, including the award-winning <em>The Jesus Creed</em> as well as <em>The King Jesus Gospel</em>, <em>A Fellowship of Differents</em>, <em>One.Life</em>, <em>The Blue Parakeet</em>, and <em>Kingdom Conspiracy</em>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>Fifty years from now, pastors, scholars, and Christians from a wide variety of denominations will look back say, &#x201c;God used A Fellowship of Differents to change the church in America!&#x201d; This is the most important book you may ever read outside of the Bible. The staff of Transformation Church will be reading this phenomenal book. -- Derwin L. Gray, lead pastor of Transformation Church; author, Limitless Life<br><br>I love this book! It&#x2019;s the theological mac to my social-psychological cheese. The pursuit of unity in the midst of difference is a trek across a minefield. With each step, we must contend with challenges that threaten to send us running back to the &#x201c;safety&#x201d; of similar others. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m so thankful for A Fellowship of Differents. McKnight draws from Paul&#x2019;s letters to give readers the robust foundation and action steps needed to keep pursuing unity at all costs. -- Christena Cleveland, author Disunity in Christ; associate professor of reconciliation studies, Bethel University<br><br>For over twenty-five years I&#x2019;ve served as a church planter and pastor of churches that wrestled with being pots of stew (or &#x201c;salad bowls,&#x201d; as Scot McKnight would put it). Pastors in my situation found ourselves ---sometimes unwittingly --- in conflict with the so-called &#x201c;homogenous unit principle,&#x201d; that highly pragmatic perspective at work in megachurches whose explosive growth had many of us drooling and sitting at the feet of CEO-pastors. Yet I craved something else: a resource to encourage and challenge us from the Scriptures, affirming our work among people of various backgrounds, different races, ethnicities, genders, and economic groups. McKnight has blended his expertise in the NT and his passion as a life-long participant in the church to address just about every topic we can imagine! I enthusiastically recommend this book! -- Rev. Dennis R. Edwards, PhD, senior pastor of The Sanctuary Covenant Church in Minneapolis<br><br>Pour yourself a cup of coffee and settle into this timely, provocative, and challenging book on what it means to be the church. McKnight&#x2019;s conversational style and his perceptive insights to American Christian culture combine with his expert analysis of Scripture to illuminate God&#x2019;s design for Christian fellowship. An essential read for all who long for the church to live out its calling. -- Lynn Cohick, professor of New Testament, Wheaton College<br><br>A Fellowship of Differents echoes God&#x2019;s plea for true community: for the church to become the real deal embracing all of God&#x2019;s different kinds of people, to unite in a &#x201c;wild revolution of equality&#x201d; through Him, to bring visibility to the otherwise invisible. Most importantly, this book shows us how true unity is the only way to achieve Jesus&#x2019; heart for his bride, the church. -- Bruxy Cavey, author of bestseller The End of Religion; teaching pastor at The Meeting House<br><br>At a moment when so many are questioning what the church is and wondering if it even matters, McKnight&#x2019;s claim --- that the way we follow Jesus is shaped by our local church more than any other source --- is a bold, prophetic, and compelling idea. Reading this book gave me a new vision for what my church is and what it could be. It was nothing short of a love affair with Jesus&#x2019; bride all over again. -- John Mark Comer, Pastor of Teaching and Vision, Bridgetown: A Jesus Church<br><br>A Fellowship of Differents is an impressive achievement: it puts the church in conversation with today&#x2019;s most difficult differences and differents --- and the church comes out making sense. Scot McKnight&#x2019;s work is precisely in step with Jesus&#x2019; famous words: &#x201c;I will build my church.&#x201d; We need this book because all of us different people in the modern church are the ones Jesus has trusted with the keys to the kingdom! -- Anglican Bishop Todd Hunter, author, Giving Church Another Chance<br><br>Ever wonder what Paul would say to the Church today? This is it. Scot McKnight has captured the mind and heart of our beloved apostle, who spent his whole life pursuing one dream, preaching one gospel, sacrificing everything for one beautiful vision: that all people would believe in the Lord because the church --- this strange collection of humanity united by the miraculous work of the Holy Spirit for one purpose --- is the very body of Christ. -- Rodney Reeves, professor of biblical studies, Southwest Baptist University<br><br>One of my life values is that uniqueness is better than conformity, firmly believing (though I realize this is strong) that conformity only leads to death. My work with church leaders shows me that healthy thriving churches are not only places of diversity, but they love that about themselves. A Fellowship of Differents will feel like a commendation to churches who already live in this tension, and like a loving and prophetic intervention for those who wrongly worship the god of sameness. -- Mark Oestreicher, partner, The Youth Cartel; Author, Hopecasting<br><br>Scot McKnight applies a professor&#x2019;s mind with a pastor&#x2019;s heart to one of the greatest enemies of God&#x2019;s plan for his church: disunity. Instead of being a &#x201c;salad bowl&#x201d; fellowship of difference and differents, we&#x2019;ve segregated ourselves into homogeneous groups so remote that we are virtually invisible to each another. The author doesn&#x2019;t stop by describing this inconvenient truth, but identifies six themes of the Christian life that, when implemented in the church by God&#x2019;s grace, will help us to love one another and flourish as one people of God. No Christ-follower who cares about the beauty of Christ&#x2019;s bride, the church, should miss this masterful guide to creating a fellowship of differents! -- Dr. E Andrew McQuitty, senior pastor of Irving Bible Church, author of Notes from the Valley<br><br>The local church certainly has its failings and therefore, its critics. Most critics are just angry and few are helpful. Scot McKnight loves the local church and because he loves the local church, his words of criticism don&#x2019;t wound as much as they remind us &#x2013; of who we once were, of who we&#x2019;re called to be, and who we can yet become. Like a parent showing a child the child&#x2019;s baby picture, Scot McKnight, in his book, A Fellowship of Differents, calls us back to the original dreams of fellowship and transformational love Jesus first intended for us &#x2013; and still intends for us now. -- Mike Glenn, Senior Pastor, Brentwood Baptist Church, Brentwood, TN<br><br>In the context of a rapidly changing world, our ecclesiology must go deeper. In a winsome manner, Scot McKnight brings the teachings of the apostle Paul to life so that we may rediscover what the church is supposed to be. A Fellowship of Differents provides a hopeful and an applicable ecclesiology for the twenty-first century that provides insight into the burden and joy of being the church. -- Dr. Soong-Chan Rah, Milton B.

With King&#x2019;s he had a lifelong connection and was elected to an Honorary Fellowship in 1946. He declared that his life as a whole had not been dramatic, and he was unfailingly modest about his achievements. Interviewed by the BBC on his eightieth birthday, he said: &#x2018;I have not written as much as I&#x2019;d like to . . . I write for two reasons: partly to make money and partly to win the respect of people whom I respect . . . I had better add that I am quite sure I am not a great novelist.&#x2019; Eminent critics and the general public have judged otherwise and in his obituary <b>The Times</b> called him &#x2018;one of the most esteemed English novelists of his time&#x2019;.<p>He wrote six novels, four of which appeared before the First World War, <b>Where Angels Fear to Tread</b> (1905), <b>The Longest Journey</b> (1907), <b>A Room with a View</b> (1908), and <b>Howard&#x2019;s End</b> (1910).

Lovers betrayed lovers, children denounced their parents, and neighbors became sworn enemies. A few years later, the townspeople have convened at the public stadium to witness the execution of Gu Shan. A Red Guard leader in her youth, she has received the death penalty for her counterrevolutionary writings and unrepentant attitude. In Yiyun Li's startling debut novel, <em>The Vagrants</em>, we are introduced to Gu's parents, neighbors, and a handful of Muddy River's social outcasts whose lives have been irrevocably affected by her life and death. Yiyun Li's unblinking and unpredictable fictional narrative demonstrates how corruption and cruelty, fear, and moral ambiguity at the level of the individual reflect the dehumanization of an entire society. <em>The Vagrants</em> establishes Li as an important new voice in American fiction. <em>--Lauren Nemroff</em><b>Yiyun Li</b> is the author of four works of fiction&#x2014;<i>Kinder Than Solitude</i>, <i>A Thousand Years of Good Prayers</i>, <i>The Vagrants</i>, and <i>Gold Boy, Emerald Girl</i>&#x2014;and the memoir <i>Dear Friend, from My Life I Write to You in Your Life</i>.

The Norse employed them as tools for communication, and the Vikings would use them as wisdom before embarking on a journey or entering battle. Runic scholar Kaedrich Olsen reclaims the transformative power of the runes for readers today as a key to unlocking our potential for personal growth and our life's vision. Runes for Transformation is unlike any other rune book on the market, with Olsen's unique techniques and applications for this ancient alphabet including affirmations, NLP, visualizations, and meditation, as well as the historical background essential to embarking on this path.</p><p>A highly respected teacher and transpersonal path worker, Kaedrich Olsen posits that the time for this "deeper working" of the runes has come and this will aid readers in both personal and collective evolution. Runes for Transformation is a rich resource and excellent guide for readers to take the steps to change their lives with a boldly modern approach to the ancient runes and for "change that really matters."</p></p><p>Kaedrich Olsen has studied the runes and Northern mysteries for over 20 years. He also studied spiritually based hypnotherapy and Shamanism in order to become a transpersonal hypnotherapist. Within this practice, he applies runic wisdom to develop powerful techniques his clients use to transform their lives. Kaedrich lives in Boulder, Colorado with his wife and two daughters, where he is an accomplished leader in the Nordic spiritual community.Believe you can change: If you have the attitude of &#34;I&#39;ll believe it when I see it,&#34; nothing will work for you. You must dive into your transformation with both feet. It is not the belief in the runic system you need, but rather the belief in yourself that you can make the change. This belief in yourself comes when you make the full commitment to change. This is a complete cycle that is self-perpetuating and has a cumulative effect. The more you do it, the stronger your power becomes until your transformation is unstoppable.</p><h2>A Girl from Yamhill</h2><p><p>Told in her own words,&nbsp;<em>A Girl from Yamhill</em>&nbsp;is Newbery Medal&#x2013;winning author Beverly Cleary&#x2019;s heartfelt and relatable memoir&#x2014;now with a beautifully redesigned cover!</p><p>Generations of children have read Beverly Cleary&#x2019;s books.

He crashed his supper plate and milk glass down beside the sink and walked out of the kitchen.<br> <br>Where did the old man think he got off?<br> <br>On the back porch he pulled off the oxford shirt and khakis he&#x2019;d put on for dinner, stripping down to the shorts and T-shirt he wore underneath. He was angry, good and angry. He was mad, good and mad. Bad and mad, bad mad&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His feet picked up the rhythm of his anger.<br> <br>He pounded down the path through the vegetable garden, heading for the water. He was PO&#x2019;d, pissed off, he was royally pissed off, and he didn&#x2019;t care what they thought. He didn&#x2019;t give a royal fart for the two of them sitting at that table back in the kitchen. Bullet made his hands into fists, brought his knees up high and stomped his feet into the dirt of the path. The way the old man talked to him, it made him mad.<br> <br>Where did he think he got off talking to him like that&#x2014;as if he still thought he could make Bullet do anything. The guy was book smart but life stupid, trying to box Bullet in with&#x2014; As if he could make him do anything.<br> <br>If it came to a fight he knew he could whip the old man with one hand, with no hands the way he felt now, just hitting at the old guy with his head and kicking&#x2014;and his teeth too. Bullet was seventeen, even if he didn&#x2019;t have the license to prove it, because he wasn&#x2019;t allowed to get a license; seventeen and he&#x2019;d wear his hair any damned way he wanted to. Angry enough to rip tendons out of the old man&#x2019;s arms with his teeth if all of his other weapons were lost. And he could do it too. Only he couldn&#x2019;t, because there never was a real fight between them. Just these petty boxing-in orders. Well, he picked and chose what orders he&#x2019;d follow, he&#x2019;d learned a while back how to do that. It wasn&#x2019;t easy, that learning, but nobody said growing up wasn&#x2019;t going to hurt.<br> <br>He came to the dock and stopped. His chest was heaving: he&#x2019;d taken the quarter mile at a full run and that was stupid. Bad enough that he had to do his running on a full stomach&#x2014;because his father wanted dinner at 5:30 exactly, and everybody he was feeding at the table to eat. Bullet couldn&#x2019;t do anything about that, but he knew better than to start out at full force. You were supposed to loosen up slowly, and now he&#x2019;d have to rest before he started his evening run. This was his third year running cross-country, he shouldn&#x2019;t be making that kind of mistake. He stood at the end of the dock, listening to his heartbeat slow, letting his muscles ease down.<br> <br>He was looking out over the water, but he felt the land stretching away behind him, flat, fertile fields marked off by tall, straggly loblollies and little stands of pines. The broad belt of marsh grass whispered under the wind, behind him, beside him. Through the soles of his sneakers he could feel the land, firm and deep, beneath him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get your hair cut. You look effeminate,&#x201d; his father had said, his voice dry as harvested hay.<br> <br>Bullet had just looked at him, but the old guy never looked at you, never looked you in the eye. Mostly, Bullet didn&#x2019;t answer his father. I don&#x2019;t have to listen to this, he said inside his head, at his father&#x2019;s face. As long as I do my work, that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re entitled to and I work my tail off.<br> <br>&#x201c;Effeminate means girlish,&#x201d; the sarcastic voice had said, as if Bullet didn&#x2019;t know that. The cold eyes had gone down to the other end of the table, where Bullet&#x2019;s mother sat. She didn&#x2019;t say anything, she never would anymore. The old man wanted to run things, and he wanted you to say something so he could knock you down with his answer and box you in tighter. If she said something, it wasn&#x2019;t her he&#x2019;d try to knock down, it was Bullet, just the way he had with Johnny first, then with Liza. Driving them away, to drive them away. Bullet&#x2019;s mother sat there, her eyes dark and angry, her mouth still as stone.<br> <br>Bullet had hooked his hair behind his ear and kept on eating.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want that hair cut tomorrow.&#x201d; His father gave the order.<br> <br>If wishes were horses, Bullet answered inside his head with the old nursery rhyme, beggars would ride. The thought struck him as funny.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or I&#x2019;ll take the scissors to you myself.&#x201d;<br> <br>No.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>There was a wind blowing up from the south, blowing in thick, heavy air. Bullet didn&#x2019;t mind that. He never minded weather, even when the muggy summer air hung so close and humid you couldn&#x2019;t sweat into it. His eyes drifted out to the end of the dock&#x2014;Johnny&#x2019;s boat was still there, still afloat. He wondered how many years it would be before the wood gave out to the weather and the thing just sank. His mother was the only one who ever took it out, and she bailed it too and scraped as much of the bottom as she could get to standing beside it in the shallow water. But she couldn&#x2019;t get it out of the water for the winter, didn&#x2019;t have time to caulk and paint the hull, never had any money, so she couldn&#x2019;t have it hauled at one of the boatyards. Too bad. Too bad the old man wouldn&#x2019;t let her get a driver&#x2019;s license either, because that meant the only way she could get around on her own was this sailboat. Which would, someday, sooner or later, just rot away.<br> <br>He turned away from the little waves, blown over the top of the water under a September sky, and let the wind hit his back. He was about ready.<br> <br>But before he could take off, he heard pattering footsteps and panting behind him, where the path came down to the shore from the marsh grasses. A cold nose touched his calf: &#x201c;Get,&#x201d; he said without looking. &#x201c;Get lost, OD.&#x201d;<br> <br>The dog ignored the order. She stood wagging her tail, her brown eyes staring up at him, her tongue lolling out of her mouth. He turned around and raised a foot to kick at her. Liza&#x2019;s old dog&#x2014;Florabella was what Liza tried to get them to call her. Bullet named her OD, for Old Dog&#x2014;and because the dog was an overdose of Liza&#x2019;s stupid softheartedness. Liza found her one morning, just swimming out in the middle of the bay. Somebody had dumped a litter of puppies overboard&#x2014;without even bothering to weight down the sack, apparently&#x2014;and this one was just swimming away stupidly, putting off drowning. Liza and Johnny got her into the boat, and Johnny had gotten the old man&#x2019;s permission for Liza to keep the puppy. That was back in the days before the old man paid much attention to any of them, before Johnny started growing up and getting angry. Bullet couldn&#x2019;t have been more than four when Liza found OD. OD was really getting to be an old dog, thirteen was pretty old for a dog. She lived in the barn and Liza used to feed her and play with her&#x2014;he guessed his mother might be feeding OD now, Liza had been gone for a few years. The only thing Liza left behind when she took off with Frank was this dog. Just like leaving something of herself behind, because the dog was about as stupid as Liza was.<br> <br>When Bullet raised his foot, OD backed off. She crouched low to the ground and waved her tail to appease him, but she kept her stupid brown eyes on his face. He turned full around, raised his arms and roared at her. She backed off, fast, afraid, stopping where the path entered the marsh grass. The grass towered over her. She was no taller than a beagle, even though she was rounder, with long golden hair. He roared again, jumped twice at her King-Kong style, and she fled up the path. He fired off a couple of oyster shells at her rump, to keep her going.<br> <br>Bullet wouldn&#x2019;t have minded a good hunting dog, a hound or a bird dog. But the old man would never let him. First it was, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too young to take the responsibility,&#x201d; then, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too old for pets.&#x201d; There was never any argument you could have with him. Unless you were Johnny, but if you were Johnny you would have been a carbon copy of the old man and Bullet didn&#x2019;t want to be that. His old man was a nothing, nothing but right answers and holding on to his precious farm.<br> <br>Bullet bent down and straightened up, ten slow toe touches, breathing in deep and easy, getting his palms flat on the ground. Hold on, he said to himself. Be fair. The old man was bad enough as he was, there was no need to be unfair. The guy was a crack shot, for one thing. Every year he got his deer, as well as the quota of goose and duck. To watch his father bring down a deer was a treat. The old guy never hesitated, never took more than one shot.<br> <br>And the old man knew about things, he&#x2019;d learned a lot and remembered it. Science and mechanics and farming, but also history and what people long dead had said&#x2014;he could answer just about any question you asked him. If you asked him a question. But he didn&#x2019;t listen to other answers, and it took Johnny years to figure that out, once Johnny had some answers of his own. Not Bullet, Bullet learned from watching the two of them, learned a lot. Johnny&#x2019;d try his own answers, and at first the old man scared him and boxed him in with how much more he knew; but as Johnny grew up he got angry instead of scared. Bullet figured it out: little kids you could keep boxed in, so that was okay with the old man; but older kids could fight back and he couldn&#x2019;t take that. The more Johnny fought back the more his father boxed the rest of them in, and Momma too. Bullet learned that, fast and good, because nobody&#x2014;he stood up straight, his arms wide, breathing air deep into his lungs&#x2014;but nobody was going to get close to boxing him in. Nobody. No way. Not ever. He&#x2019;d been his own man for years.<br> <br>Bullet started on the run. Beginning in March, he ran his ten- mile course every evening. Up five miles along the shoreline, back five miles. Rain or sleet made no difference to him. He&#x2019;d be out there in his shorts, T-shirt and sneakers. Cross-country took that kind of training. Bullet didn&#x2019;t have to train like this to win the races, but that wasn&#x2019;t what he was after, anyway, just winning. He had to train to keep getting better, to be as good as he could. And he was really good.<br> <br>The course started off along the narrow beach, then cut inland&#x2014;up over the eroded banks and fallen trees, through undergrowth, then back down to the muddy sand. Sometimes Bullet swerved inland to a field and pelted across it, his footing tested by the furrows with dried cornstalks like giant stubble, every footfall calculated. Sometimes he made short zigzagging spurts, ten yards up a beach, then five at the overgrown land&#x2019;s edge, testing the spring in his legs and his ability to get over obstacles, or through them.<br> <br>You never knew what kind of land a cross-country course would cover. The disadvantage of training down on the eastern shore was that the land was so flat. The meets up north, or in the western part of the state, could be killers if you weren&#x2019;t used to working uphill. Cross-country was a killer anyway, but that was why Bullet liked it. Running around a cinder track, or even hurdling when they put jumps up at specified distances, you might as well be a horse, a trained horse going over the jumps they put out for you. But cross-country&#x2014;he turned at the edge of a field where a pumpkin crop was ripening up and headed south again&#x2014;cross-country was really tough. You had to be fast, but that was just the beginning. You had to have endurance, too, and quick reflexes. You were going to fall, you always did, but you had to get up fast and keep going. And smart, you had to be able to look at what lay ahead and get ready for it, you had to run smart.<br> <br>Somewhere between the eighth and ninth mile, he began to feel the work his muscles were doing. From then on, he ran on strength alone, keeping up the steady pace, just not paying any attention to what his body was trying to say to him. After a little while he didn&#x2019;t feel anything. He&#x2019;d run past it, run through it, and his body got back to the work he intended it to do. A year ago, Bullet would have hit that point at around five miles&#x2014;hit it and gutted his way through it.<br> <br>For the last quarter mile he ran along the flat beach. That was the way most cross-country courses were, too, a flat run at the end. Bullet sprinted, driving his feet into the wet sand, pumping his arms faster, to force the faster rhythm on his legs.<br> <br>Back at the dock again he stood straight.<br> <br>He wanted to fall down onto the boards&#x2014;he could have thrown up his whole supper without any trouble at all, lots of guys did just that at the end of every race. But Bullet stood straight and locked his throat tight. His chest heaved, he couldn&#x2019;t even focus his eyes on anything, as if a film of blood spread over his retinas. He stood straight, arms loose at his sides, his shaking legs holding him firm. Every muscle in his body had been used and felt it.<br> <br>Sweat poured down his back and legs, stung in his eyes, soaked his armpits. He liked that smell of sweat.<br> <br>When his vision cleared, he took a look at the sun. His time was okay. He looked at the water and wanted to fall into it, but because he wanted to, he waited. He knew he could do that to himself, for himself; he&#x2019;d learned that, too.<br> <br>The sun hung red, just above the watery horizon&#x2014;as if it were being sucked down into the water. The water reflected the cloudless gray-blue of the sky. When he no longer needed to, Bullet allowed himself to go swimming. The tide was up. Wind slapped the waves against the sides of Johnny&#x2019;s boat. A single star burned low above the horizon, obscured by the brightness of the sun. Bullet did a shallow dive off the end of the dock, then splashed around for a while. This late in the year you didn&#x2019;t have to worry much about jellyfish. Water soaked his clothes and shoes and all of his skin. He hauled himself back up onto the dock and sat there, looking out. His sneakers were heavy. His hair was plastered onto his forehead and clammy down the back of his neck.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t even as if his hair was that long, only halfway down his neck, and it looked good, thick and dark brown like his mother&#x2019;s. Some of the people at school&#x2014;they had hair so long they kept it tied back in ponytails. The old man wanted him to have a crew cut, as if there was something wrong about a good head of hair on a man, as if that had anything to do with anything. It wasn&#x2019;t haircuts the old man cared about, it was being able to give orders. With Johnny gone and Liza gone, there was only Bullet to give orders to. You&#x2019;d think the old man would learn.<br> <br>Bullet swung his feet back and forth, the weight of wet sneakers pulling at his thigh muscles. The farm lay behind him, all the flat acres of it, broad fields, patches of woods where raccoons and rabbits and squirrels lived, fields left fallow, fields where cornstalks dried in the September sun, lines of loblollies&#x2014;he didn&#x2019;t look back, he didn&#x2019;t have to, to see it. He looked across the water at the horizon, to the invisible western shore.<br> <br>The farm was his now, both a draft deferment and a job. If he wanted it. After a couple of years, when Johnny just didn&#x2019;t ever come back, the old man said that to him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be yours.&#x201d; Ignoring Liza. Bullet just shook his head. The old man thought Bullet was scared of the hard work, but he wasn&#x2019;t, and the old man only thought that because it was an idea he got hold of. The old man got hold of ideas and kept them, clenched tight in his fist, as if that made them true. It was boxes Bullet was afraid of, the kind of boxes the old man built around people he lived with. The draft was a kind of box, too, except that Bullet wasn&#x2019;t so sure he&#x2019;d mind the army, and he knew for certain he&#x2019;d make a good soldier; the same way he knew for certain what it would cost him to stay on the farm, waiting for the old man to die.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t as if his father even wanted Bullet to have the farm. He didn&#x2019;t, he didn&#x2019;t want to let go of the farm ever.

EAT, RACE and WIN.</p><p>Hannah Grant, The star of the Emmy winning Amazon Prime Original show Eat. Race. Win. Based on the best selling cookbook, The Grand Tour cookbook. She was born in Denmark in 1982 to a Danish mother and Scottish father and grew up in a loving and creative family filled with people from the theatre and the restaurant industry. It fired her passion for food, creativity and cooking which has been her life s work. After a year spent in the Danish Royal Navy in 2003, Hannah joined the culinary institute of Copenhagen to pursue her dream of combining creative skills and cooking with traveling, all the while continuing to learn, evolve and develop. First she spent a year on a kite boarding expedition boat sailing the South Pacific. Hannah sourced local ingredients and cooked wholesome meals for the kiteboarders and surfers on board. It was an experience that triggered a new and exciting interest in nutrition, special diets and performance fuel. It was the start of a unique culinary adventure that shaped her life Diploma in hand she then ventured into some of the best restaurants in the world including the Fat Duck in the UK and Noma in Denmark before the door opened onto a completely different world of food and endurance sport. In 2010, Hannah was hired by Bjarne Riis to cook for the riders on his professional cycling team. Throughout the season she travelled full time with the team through the incredible culinary touchpoints of France, Italy and Spain. During her 5 years with the team Hannah developed a close working relationship with Sports physiologist Dr. Stacy Sims Ph.d. The pair clicked instantly and started bringing innovative ideas to the table about fueling endurance athletes at the highest level. It was the start of the process that would end with the publication of the Grand Tour Cookbook in 2013. Originally published in Danish, then translated into English, French and German in 2015. The core themes of the book was translated into the TV show Eat, Ride, Win (Amazon Prime) which followed Hannah and her crew as they cooked for a cycling team throughout the 2017 Tour de France. Hannah Grant has worked with recipe development for her own brand as well as in collaboration with various Magazines and companies for over a decade as well as doing motivational speaking and workshops. She is currently working on a pioneering start-up, ERW, creating an anti jet lag product my flight pack; for frequent flyers and athletes. geterw.comHannah Grant has fast become one of my idol chefs. I love good simple food, and I also love bike riding - riding far, and riding fast. Hannah's recipes combine the two adorations perfectly; great, simple food, made to be the perfect fuel for endurance sport. 'Eat Race Win' is her latest book release. 'The Grand Tour Cookbook' was the first cycling-orientated recipe book released by Hannah Grant. I reviewed it back in 2015 (read the review here), and it would be accurate to say that it has become an almost biblical reference whenever we are looking for tasty and wholesome dishes in our household. 'Eat. Race. Win.' is the sequel to 'The Grand Tour Cookbook', and provides a whole new bank of superb recipes to try. The book is beautifully illustrated, and with some interesting and inspiring insights on both cycling and cookery. This is a cookbook worthy of being placed on your coffee table. The recipes themselves are the real talking point though... whether it is the fuelling breakfasts, the recovery dinners, or the indulgent treats; every recipe I have tried to date has been superb. Particular favourites of mine include the 'Pink Grapefruit, Blueberries and Dulce de Leche on Oats' to set you up for the day, and the 'Plums, Fennel and Radicchio with Tarragon and Toasted Hazelnut Salad' at dinnertime. Hannah has done it again with 'Eat Race Win' - this book will take prime position on my kitchen window ledge, right next to 'The Grand Tour Cookbook'. It is a collection of recipes that you can reach out to, execute with ease, and deliver the best fuel your body could wish for.

Watching Cecilia is their housekeeper&#x2019;s son Robbie Turner, a childhood friend who, along with Briony&#x2019;s sister, has recently graduated from Cambridge.<br><br>By the end of that day the lives of all three will have been changed forever. Robbie and Cecilia will have crossed a boundary they had never before dared to approach and will have become victims of the younger girl&#x2019;s scheming imagination. And Briony will have committed a dreadful crime, the guilt for which will color her entire life.<br><br>In each of his novels Ian McEwan has brilliantly drawn his reader into the intimate lives and situations of his characters. But never before has he worked with so large a canvas: In <i>Atonement </i>he takes the reader from a manor house in England in 1935 to the retreat from Dunkirk in 1941; from the London&#x2019;s World War II military hospitals to a reunion of the Tallis clan in 1999.<br><br><i>Atonement</i> is Ian McEwan&#x2019;s finest achievement. Brilliant and utterly enthralling in its depiction of childhood, love and war, England and class, the novel is at its center a profound&#x2013;and profoundly moving&#x2013;exploration of shame and forgiveness and the difficulty of absolution.</p><p>Ian McEwan's Booker Prize-nominated <i>Atonement</i> is his first novel since <i>Amsterdam</i> took home the prize in 1998. But while <i>Amsterdam</i> was a slim, sleek piece, <i>Atonement</i> is a more sturdy, more ambitious work, allowing McEwan more room to play, think, and experiment.<p> We meet 13-year-old Briony Tallis in the summer of 1935, as she attempts to stage a production of her new drama "The Trials of Arabella" to welcome home her older, idolized brother Leon. But she soon discovers that her cousins, the glamorous Lola and the twin boys Jackson and Pierrot, aren't up to the task, and directorial ambitions are abandoned as more interesting prospects of preoccupation come onto the scene. The charlady's son, Robbie Turner, appears to be forcing Briony's sister Cecilia to strip in the fountain and sends her obscene letters; Leon has brought home a dim chocolate magnate keen for a war to promote his new "Army Ammo" chocolate bar; and upstairs, Briony's migraine-stricken mother Emily keeps tabs on the house from her bed. Soon, secrets emerge that change the lives of everyone present....</p><p> The interwar, upper-middle-class setting of the book's long, masterfully sustained opening section might recall Virginia Woolf or Henry Green, but as we move forward--eventually to the turn of the 21st century--the novel's central concerns emerge, and McEwan's voice becomes clear, even personal. For at heart, <i>Atonement</i> is about the pleasures, pains, and dangers of writing, and perhaps even more, about the challenge of controlling what readers make of your writing. McEwan shouldn't have any doubts about readers of <i>Atonement</i>: this is a thoughtful, provocative, and at times moving book that will have readers applauding. <i>--Alan Stewart, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>"The engrossing new novel by the winner of the 1998 Booker Prize &#x201c;hauls a defining part of the British literary tradition up to and into the 21st century.&#x201d; &#x2013;Geoff Dyer, <i>The Guardian<br><br></i>&#x201c;It is rare for a critic to feel justified in using the word &#x201c;masterpiece,&#x201d; but Ian McEwan&#x2019;s new book really deserves to be called one...<i>Atonement </i>is a work of astonishing depth and humanity... This novel really is worthy of the Booker.&#x201d; <i>&#x2013;The Economist<br></i><br>&#x201c;The narrative, as always with McEwan, smoulders with slow-burning menace. the book is magically readable and never has McEwan shown himself to be more in sympathy with the vulnerability of the human heart.&#x201d; <i>&#x2013;The Sunday Times<br></i><br>&#x201c;McEwan is a consistently entertaining storyteller, giving good weight right up until the final page. Even by his exacting standards his latest novel is extraordinary.

In addition, beginning at the age of five, Sellars was isolated for two years at Coqualeetza Indian Turberculosis Hospital in Sardis, British Columbia, nearly six hours&#x2019; drive from home. The trauma of these experiences has reverberated throughout her life.<br><br>The first full-length memoir to be published out of St. Joseph&#x2019;s Mission at Williams Lake, BC, Sellars tells of three generations of women who attended the school, interweaving the personal histories of her grandmother and her mother with her own. She tells of hunger, forced labour, and physical beatings, often with a leather strap, and also of the demand for conformity in a culturally alien institution where children were confined and denigrated for failure to be White and Roman Catholic.<br><br>Like Native children forced by law to attend schools across Canada and the United States, Sellars and other students of St. Joseph&#x2019;s Mission were allowed home only for two months in the summer and for two weeks at Christmas. The rest of the year they lived, worked, and studied at the school. St. Joseph&#x2019;s Mission is the site of the controversial and well-publicized sex-related offences of Bishop Hubert O&#x2019;Connor, which took place during Sellars&#x2019;s student days, between 1962 and 1967, when O&#x2019;Connor was the school principal. After the school&#x2019;s closure, those who had been forced to attend came from surrounding reserves and smashed windows, tore doors and cabinets from the wall, and broke anything that could be broken. Overnight their anger turned a site of shameful memory into a pile of rubble.<br><br>In this frank and poignant memoir, Sellars breaks her silence about the institution&#x2019;s lasting effects, and eloquently articulates her own path to healing.</p><br></p><p>Bev Sellars: Bev Sellars is Chief of the the Xat&#39;sull (Soda Creek) First Nation in Williams Lake, British Columbia.

All those years of abuse and putdowns finally caught up to me that night. I was so tired of trying to fit in somewhere, anywhere. A silly incident was the deciding factor. If anything was going to make me take my life, it should have been worse things that had happened in the past, yet that is all it took.&nbsp; At the time, it did not seem so little.&nbsp; That moment meant life or death, and I chose death.&nbsp; There did not seem to be any point to living.</p> <p>I had taken my Mom&#x2019;s bottle of sleeping pills away from her earlier that day because she had been drinking and had talked about taking <i>her</i> life. As unhappy as Mom's life was, I still thought she had reasons to live. Now, there I was holding the pills in my hand. I threw them in my mouth and swallowed easily. I lay down in the bedroom and waited to go to sleep. I did not think about people who were worse off than I was. I did not think about the family and friends I would hurt. I just thought about how lost and lonely I felt and how desperately I wanted out of this world, a world that seemed to offer only intense unhappiness. I did not have to wait long before I felt myself going to sleep ...</p> <p>I started writing this book in the early 1990s when our communities first started to explore and deal with the &#x201c;aftermath&#x201d; of the Indian residential schools. A close relative heard that I was writing a book and said to me angrily, &#x201c;I heard you are writing a book. Boy, you better not be writing anything about me!&#x201d; This reaction changed my mind about making my story public, but I continued putting my thoughts and memories on paper. In 2004 I decided to finish the book, even if it turned out to be only an historical record for my family.</p> <p>I asked myself, &#x201c;Is it possible to make other people feel what I once felt and understand the message I am trying to convey? Is it possible to make others realize the damage they are doing to themselves and their loved ones? Is it possible to help others by writing of my experiences, or will it only create tension with my loved ones who have been a part of those experiences? Should my memories stay just memories?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>I have concluded that I had to write this book and share with those who I know are suffering the same experiences as me. In speaking with others who went to the residential schools in other areas of Canada I am amazed at how similar our stories are about the treatment of the children. It is as if the various churches running the schools were all in the same training program on how to run these schools.</p> <p>My restricted view of the world and the oppressive conditions under which I lived were not the only options for me, although my experiences until then did not reveal otherwise. In writing the book, I have realized that I am still disassembling the restrictive world in which I once lived.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>WHAT PAIN HAVE YOU SUFFERED?</p> <p>In the early 1990s, I went into the local shopping mall in Williams Lake, British Columbia. I noticed a couple of women who were both at St. Joseph&#x2019;s Mission while I was there. I went over to say hello and our conversation got around to my speaking out about the residential schools. One of the women said to me, &#x201c;Why do you speak on residential schools? What pain have you suffered in your life that qualifies you to speak on the schools?&#x201d; I was surprised at her question. I do not remember my response.<br>&nbsp;<br>How do you measure pain? Some students looked forward to going back to the mission because their homes were so chaotic from all the alcohol in their communities. Unfortunately, some kids did not have a home to go to during our holidays. The woman who asked me the question was one of those whose home was completely broken because of alcoholism. Does that make her suffering more than mine? Or was my pain more because I knew there was something better at home for me than the life and abuses we suffered at the schools? Does the fact that I chose not to become addicted to alcohol or drugs disqualify me from suffering?&nbsp; Or, was my suffering more because I did not live my life in a fog that alcohol and drugs provided? If I chose to live through it, deal with it, feel the full extent of the pain and allow myself to grow emotionally and mentally, does that lessen my suffering?<br>&nbsp;<br>Others in different countries have been persecuted. The Jewish peoples, the people in Rwanda and Bosnia, the Black people in the United States and others have atrocious stories to tell. Aboriginal people in Canada have a story to tell as well, a story of which most non-Aboriginal people in Canada are unaware. All of this happened in a country that proudly boasts as being one of the best places in the world to live; a supposedly democratic country where the freedoms and cultures of all are protected and respected. It is the greatest place to live for anyone, except for the original inhabitants of this land, the Aboriginal people.<br>&nbsp;<br>I am angry about the way Aboriginal people have been and still are treated in Canada, but writing this book has allowed me to grow. I realize that complaining about the treatment of our people is justified, but doing something about it is more important. I found that I was not able to do anything to help my family, my community and Aboriginal people in general until I learned to help myself. Despite all of our experiences, it rests within each one of us to live up to our full potential.<br>&nbsp;<br>I read somewhere that everyone is born with the potential for success, and it is only through life&#x2019;s experiences that we develop or destroy that potential. For many Aboriginal people, our most vulnerable and impressionable years, our childhood years, were spent at residential schools. Our mental, emotional and spiritual growth was extremely stunted because of the way we were treated there.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>You have to tell our story like it is, don&#x2019;t hold back or make it seem like it wasn&#x2019;t as bad as it actually was. People have to know and believe what happened to us. That&#x2019;s what hurts ... when people don&#x2019;t believe what happened.</i></p> <p>That is what Charlie Gilbert from the Williams Lake Indian Band (a.k.a. Sugar Cane) said to me when I started speaking out about the residential schools and the damage done to our people. I cannot tell everyone&#x2019;s story. Others have told me some horrific stories about things that happened at residential schools, including a few potential murders but they are not my stories to tell.

Using the Beatitudes from the Bible as a platform for her extended free-verse poem, Weatherford traces the arc of African-American history, starting with the slave era and ending with the swearing-in of President Barack Obama. Along the way, Weatherford alludes to a host of notable African-American figures, including Harriet Tubman, Booker T. Washington, Rosa Parks and Marian Anderson &#x2014; individuals whose determination and endurance helped make freedom a reality. Tim Ladwig's beautifully realistic renderings of U. S. Colored Troops, Freedom Riders and civil rights organizers give the book a documentary feel. With&nbsp;<i>The Beatitudes</i>, Weatherford &#x2014; winner of the Caldecott Honor for her book<i>Moses: When Harriet Tubman Led Her People to Freedom</i>&nbsp;&#x2014; offers an inspiring review of black history and the ways in which spirituality has guided its leaders. The book includes brief biographies of the famous figures who appear in Weatherford's poem. This is a special testament to the legacy of a people &#x2014; a book that's sure to be treasured by future generations of readers."&nbsp;<b><i>School Library Journal</i></b><br> "Weatherford uses the Beatitudes (Matthew 5:3-12 KJV) as backdrop for a powerful, beautifully produced book. In free verse, she relates the story in first person &#x2014; 'I am the Lord your God,' &#x2014; tracing the African-American journey from slavery through the Civil Rights Movement to the inauguration of Barack Obama. Each page begins, 'I was with . . .' as Weatherford focuses on a particular person (Harriet Tubman, Marian Anderson, Emmett Till, Martin Luther King, Jr.) or an event (slave ships, freedom rides, right-to-vote movement). Verses, short and meaningful, carry forth a poignant message, reinforced by Ladwig's inspired, richly hued, expressive illustrations. The words of the Beatitudes, which are printed in their entirety at the book's beginning, run across the bottoms of the pages in softly colored type, making a constant connection to the pictures. In addition, the artist's choice of perspective is exemplary: angry white hecklers back an image of a hopeful-looking Ruby Bridges; Lincoln looks down on a crowded Mall as Marian Anderson sings to the throngs, and Martin Luther King, Jr., gazing into a reflecting pool, sees the smiling faces of two girls (one black and one white). Regardless of race or religion, this is a book to share with today's children who live in a discordant world too often lacking in kindness and civility."&nbsp;<b><i>Booklist</i></b><br> "Using the Beatitudes of blessings found in the Sermon on the Mount as an underpinning, Weatherford highlights the faith that bolstered the African American struggle for freedom and civil rights. Running along the bottom of the pages, the words serve as a refrain to punctuate Ladwig's elegant watercolors and lend a dreamlike quality to the stirring depictions. The art begins with a portrayal of an anonymous man enduring the Middle Passage, a single beam of light falling across his still-hopeful face, and ends with the much-anticipated inauguration of President Obama. This powerful picture book charts the progress of African Americans in the U.S. in much the same manner as Michelle Cook's&nbsp;<i>Our Children Can Soar</i>. However, instead of a relay-race-style handoff of accomplishments, Weatherford's text illustrates the spiritual presence in the lives of those making a difference. Whether 'ringing the church bells' or 'beating the drum for freedom,' the Lord was with them."&nbsp;<b><i>Kids Lit</i>&nbsp;(blog)</b><br> "Weatherford has taken Jesus' Sermon on the Mount and created a poem that follows African-American history from slavery through to the election of Barack Obama. . . Weatherford's words are strong and ringing. They both celebrate and mourn, moving ever onward to a brighter future. The book shines with a beautiful combination of faith and history. Ladwig's illustrations add to that shine with strong people shown in moments of strength. . . Highly recommended, this is a book that truly captures the strength of a people.

"It's getting dark and there's nothing here." He shouldered his caving equipment, not surprised that they hadn't found an entrance to an ice cave. If no one had discovered the cave by this time in the Carpathian Mountains, he doubted if the place existed.</p> <p>Lara Calladine ignored him, continuing to scan the mountainside for the smallest crack that might signal the presence of a cave. She wasn't wrong not this time. Power had surged and crackled the moment she set foot on the upper slopes of the mountain. She took a deep breath and pressed a hand over her pounding heart. This was it. This was the place she had spent her life searching for. She would recognize that flow of energy anywhere. She knew every weave, every spell, her body absorbing the gathering power so that veins sizzled and nerve endings burned with the electrical current building inside of her.</p> <p>"I've got to go with Terry on this," Gerald French agreed, backing up the other member of their research caving team. "This place gives me the creeps. We've been on a lot of mountains, but this one doesn't like us." He gave a nervous laugh. "It's getting dicey up here."</p> <p>"No one says &#x2018;dicey,' " Lara murmured, running her hand along the face of the rock about an inch from it, looking for threads of power. The two men were not only her climbing partners, but her closest friends. At that moment she wished she'd left them behind, because she knew she was right. The cave was here, she just had to find the entrance.</p> <p>"Whatever," Gerald snapped. "It's getting dark and there's nothing here but mist. The fog is creepy, Lara. We've got to get out of here."</p> <p>Lara spared the two men an impatient glance and then surveyed the countryside around them. Ice and snow glittered, coating the surrounding mountains with what appeared to be sparkling gems. Far below, despite the gathering dusk, she could see castles, farms and churches in the valley. Sheep dotted the meadows and in the distance she could see the river running, filled to capacity. Overhead, birds cried, filling the sky and dive-bombing toward her only to break off abruptly and circle again. The wind shifted continuously, biting at her face and every bit of exposed skin, tugging at her long, thick braid all the while moaning and wailing. Occasionally, a rock fell down the slope and bounced off the ledge to the hillside below. A trickle of snow and dirt slid near her feet.</p> <p>Her gaze swept the wild countryside below. Gorges and ravines cut through the snow-capped mountains, plants clung to the sides of the rocks and shivered naked along the plateaus. She could see the entrances to several caves and felt the strong pull toward them as if they were tempting her to leave her current position. Water filled the deeper depressions below, forming a dark peat bog, and beds of moss were a vivid green in stark contrast to the browns surrounding them. But she needed to be here in this spot this place. She had studied the geography carefully and knew, deep within the earth, a massive series of ice caves had formed.</p> <p>The higher she climbed, the smaller everything below her looked and the thicker the white mist surrounding her became. With each step, the ground shifted subtly and the birds overhead shrieked a little louder. Ordinary things, yes, but the subtle sense of uneasiness, the continual voice whispering to leave before it was too late told her this was a place of power protecting itself. Although the wind continued to wail and blow, the mist remained a thick veil shrouding the upper slope.</p> <p>"Come on, Lara," Terry tried again. "It took us forever to get the permits, we can't waste time on the wrong area. You can see nothing's here."</p> <p>It had taken considerable effort this time, to get the permits for her study, but she had managed the usual way using her gifts to persuade those who disagreed with her that due to global warming concerns, the ice caves needed immediate study. Unique microorganisms called extremophiles thrived in the harsh environment of the caves, far away from sunlight or traditional nutrients. Scientists hoped those microbes could aid in the fight against cancer or even produce an antibiotic capable of wiping out the newest emerging superbugs.</p> <p>Her research project was fully funded and, although she was considered young at the age of twenty-seven, she was acknowledged as the leading expert in the field of ice-cave study and preservation. She'd logged more hours exploring, mapping and studying the ice caves around the world than most other researchers twice her age. She'd also discovered more superbugs than any other caver.</p> <p>"Didn't it strike you as odd that no one wanted us in this particular region? They were fine giving us permits to look virtually anywhere else," she pointed out. Part of the reason she'd persisted when no caves had been mapped in the area was because the department head had been so strange strange and rather vague when they went over the map. The natural geographical deduction after studying the area was that a vast network of ice caves lay beneath the mountain, yet the entire region seemed to have been overlooked.</p> <p>Terry and Gerald had exhibited exactly the same behavior, as if they didn't notice the structure of the mountain, but both men were superb at finding ice caves from the geographical surface. Persuasion had been difficult, but all of that work was for this moment this cave this find.</p> <p>"It's here," she said with absolute confidence.</p> <p>Her heart continued to pound not at the excitement of the find but because walking had become such a chore, her body not wanting to continue forward. She breathed away the compulsion to leave and pressed through the safeguards, following the trail of power, judging how close she was to the entrance by how strong her need to run away was.</p> <p>Voices rose in the wind, swirled in the mists, telling her to go back, to leave while she could. Strangely, she heard the voices in several languages, the warning much stronger and more insistent as she made her way along the slope searching for anything at all that might signal an entrance to the caves she knew were there. All the while she kept all senses alert to the possibility that monsters might lurk beneath the earth, but she had to enter to find the place of her nightmares, the place of her childhood. She had to find the two dragons she dreamed of nightly.</p> <p>"Lara!" This time, Terry's voice was sharp with protest. "We have to get out of here."</p> <p>Barely sparing him a second glance, Lara stood for a long moment studying the outcropping that jutted out from smoother rock. Thick snow covered most of it, but there was an oddity about the formation that kept drawing her gaze back to the rock. She approached cautiously. Several small rocks lay at the foot of the larger boulders, and strangely, not a single snowflake stuck to them. She didn't touch them, but studied them from every angle, observing carefully the way they were arranged in a pattern at the foot of the outcropping.</p> <p>"Something out of place," she murmured aloud.</p> <p>Instantly the wind wailed, the sound rising to a shriek as it rushed toward her, blowing debris into the air so that it shot at her like small missiles.</p> <p>"It's the rocks. See, they should be arranged differently." Lara leaned down and pushed the small pile of rocks into a different pattern.</p> <p>At once the ground shifted beneath them. The mountain creaked in protest. Bats took to the air, pouring out of some unseen hole a short distance from them, filling the sky until it was nearly black. The dark crack along the outcropping split wider. The mountain shuddered and shook and groaned as if alive, as if it was coming awake.</p> <p>"We shouldn't be here," Terry nearly sobbed.</p> <p>Lara took a deep breath and held her palm toward the narrow slit in the mountainside, the only entrance to this particular cave. Power blasted out at her, and all around she could feel the safeguards, thick and ominous, protecting the entrance.</p> <p>"You're right, Terry," she agreed. "We shouldn't." She backed away from the outcropping and gestured toward the trail. "Let's go. And hurry." For the first time she was really aware of the time, the way the gathering darkness spread like a stain across the sky.</p> <p>She would be coming back early morning without her two companions. She had no idea what was left in the elaborate ice caverns below, but she wasn't about to expose two of her closest friends to danger. The safeguards in place would confuse them, so they wouldn't remember the location of the cave, but she knew each weave, each spell, and how to reverse it so that the guards wouldn't affect her.</p> <p>Ice caves as a whole were dangerous at all times. The continual pressure from overlying ice caps often sent great frozen chunks of ice blasting out of the walls, fired like rockets, capable of killing anything they struck. But this particular cave harbored dangers far outweighing natural ones and she didn't want her companions anywhere near it.</p> <p>The ground shifted again, throwing all of them off balance. Gerald grabbed her to keep her from falling and Terry caught at the outcropping, fingers digging into the widening crack. Beneath their feet, something under the ground moved, raising the surface several inches as the creature raced toward the base of the rocks Lara had realigned.</p> <p>"What is that?" Gerald shouted, backpedaling. He thrust Lara behind him in an effort to protect her as the dirt and snow spouted into a geyser almost at his feet.</p> <p>Terry screamed, his voice high-pitched and frightened as he tipped over backward and the unseen creature raced toward him beneath the earth.</p> <p>"Get up! Move!" Lara called, trying to get around Gerald's sold bulk to throw a holding spell. As he swung around, Gerald's backpack knocked her off her feet and sent her rolling down the steeper slope. Her birthmark, the strangely shaped dragon positioned just over her left ovary suddenly flared into life, burning through her skin and glowing red-hot.</p> <p>Two dark green tentacles burst from the snow-covered ground, slick with blood, the color so dark it nearly was black, emerging on either side of Terry's left ankle. The sound of bubbling mud rose along with a noxious, putrid stink of rotten eggs and sulfur, so overpowering the three of them gagged. The bulbous tops of the tentacles reared back, revealing coiling snake heads that struck with brutal speed. Two curved, venomous fangs clamped from either side through Terry's skin nearly to the bone. Terry screamed and flailed in terror as his blood dripped into the pristine snow. The small gap in the ground began to widen into a larger hole a few feet from Terry. At once, the tentacles retreated toward the hole, slithering across the surface, dragging Terry by his ankle. His screams of fear and pain grew louder, shrill and panicked.</p> <p>Gerald flung himself forward, gripping Terry under his arms and throwing his weight in the opposite direction. "Hurry, Lara!"</p> <p>Lara scrambled to the top of the slope. The mist whirled and thickened around her, making it difficult to see. She spread her arms as she ran, gathering energy from the darkening sky, uncaring that her companions might see, knowing she was Terry's only chance for survival. Never once since leaving the ice caves had she used the knowledge inside of her, the wealth of information her aunts had shared with her, embedding memory after memory in her mind indeed, she hadn't been certain it was real. Until that moment. Power flooded her. Her mind opened. Expanded. Reached into the well of knowledge and found the exact words she needed.</p> <p>"It's too strong." Gerald dug his heels into the earth and held on to Terry with every ounce of strength he possessed. "Stop wasting your energy and help me, damn it. Come on, Terry, fight."</p> <p>Terry ceased screaming abruptly and began to fight in earnest, kicking with his free leg in an attempt to dislodge the two snake heads.</p> <p>The vine threw more tentacles out, the greenish black stems writhing hideously, looking for a target. The teeth sank deeper into Terry's ankle, sawing at flesh and bone in an effort to keep their prey.</p> <p>Lara flung herself forward, lifting her face to the sky as she muttered the words she found in her mind.</p> <p><i>I call forth the power of the sky. Bring down lightning to my mind's eye. Shaping, shifting, bend to my will. Forging a scythe to sharpened steel. Hot and bright the fire be, guide my hand with accuracy.</i></p> <p>Lightning zigzagged across the sky, lighting the edges of the clouds. The air around them charged so that the hair on their bodies and heads stood out. Lara felt electricity snapping and sizzling in her fingertips and focused on the thinner space between the long, thick bodies and the bulbous heads of the snake vines.</p> <p>White light streaked across the short distance and pierced the necks of the creatures. The smell of rotting flesh burst from the vine. Both severed tentacles dropped limply to the ground, leaving the teeth, with the heads attached, still sunk deep into Terry's ankle. The rest of the tentacles reared back in shock and then burrowed beneath the dirt and snow.</p> <p>Terry grasped one of the heads to pull it out.</p> <p>"No!" Lara protested. "Leave it. We have to get out of here right now."</p> <p>"It burns like acid," Terry complained. His face was pale, nearly as white as the covering of snow, but beads of sweat dotted his forehead.</p> <p>Lara shook her head. "We have to get off this mountain now. And you can't take chances until I can look at it."</p> <p>She took his arm and signaled to Gerald to grab his other one. They steadied Terry between them and began to hurry from the slope to the well-traveled path off to their right.</p> <p>"What was that?" Gerald hissed, his eyes meeting hers over Terry's head. "Have you ever seen a snake like that before?"</p> <p>"Was it two-headed?" Terry asked. Anxiety made him hyperventilate. "I didn't get all that good a look at it before it struck. Do you think it's poisonous?"</p> <p>"It isn't attacking your central nervous system, Terry," Lara said, "at least not yet. We'll get you back down to the village and find a doctor. I know a few things about medicine. I can treat you when we get to the car."</p> <p>The mountain rumbled ominously, shivering beneath their feet. Lara glanced up at the swirling white mists. Above them, spiderweb cracks appeared in the snow and began to widen.</p> <p>Gerald swore, renewed his grip on Terry and started sprinting along the thin, winding trail. "It's going to come down."</p> <p>Terry gritted his teeth against the pain radiating up from his ankle. "I can't believe this is happening. I feel sick."</p> <p>Lara kept her eyes on the mountain behind them as they raced, dragging Terry every step of the way. "Faster. Keep moving."</p> <p>The ground shifted and rolled and small fans of snow slid in artful patterns toward the slope below them. The sight was dazzling, hypnotic even. Gerald shook his head several times and looked at Lara, puzzled, slowing down to look around at the undulating snow. "Lara? I can't remember what happened. Where are we?"</p> <p>"We're about to be creamed by an avalanche, Gerald," Lara warned. "Terry's hurt and w...</p></p><h2>Lessons from a Desperado Poet</h2><p><p>Part memoir, part how-to, all Baxter Black, <i>Lessons from a Desperado Poet </i>is a humorous, witty take on making a living by doing the right thing and trying everything.

He currently teaches at the SUNY at Purchase.</p><b>Chapter 1</b><br>A Gathering of Traditions<br>Even as his body began to fail, for Oscar Peterson (1925-2007) the piano remained a lifeline. The instrument had long been a trusted companion-sparking early dreams, conferring a place in the history books, and easing his way in a world of racial strife. Now, at eighty- one, he looked worn out. Arriving at the stage of New York's Birdland in a wheelchair, after debilitating strokes had weakened his legs and slowed his left hand, he struggled to move his heavy frame onto the piano bench.<br><br>Yet, as soon as the keyboard was within reach, even before his torso had completed its fall into a seated position, he thrust out his right arm and grabbed a handful of notes; at that signal, the bass player, drummer, and guitarist launched into their first number. And suddenly there was that sound. He still had it-a musical personality as large as life, steeped in tradition yet recognizably, unmistakably all its own.<br><br>For decades, Peterson's technical command and musical instincts had instilled in others the kind of awe and fear he expressed about his idol, the late Art Tatum. He once compared that older piano master to a lion: an animal that scares you to death, though you can't resist getting close enough to hear it roar. (Classical firebrands Sergei Rachmaninoff and Vladimir Horowitz went to hear Tatum perform and came away with the same sense of intimidation.) And that made his comeback all the more difficult.<br><br>The Peterson style was always characterized by rapid, graceful, blues- tinged melody lines unfurled in long, weaving phrases with the inexorable logic of an epic narrative; and, equally important, a visceral sense of rhythm, transmitted with fire and snap. Those qualities for which he was renowned-effortless fluidity and clockwork precision-were not merely aspects of his playing; they were the very foundation on which his artistic expression rested. And pulling them off required the highest level of athletic prowess.<br><br>At times that evening in 2006, in one of the few scheduled performances on what would turn out to be his farewell tour to the world, flashes of the old brilliance emerged, unscathed by illness and time. Yet the strain was also clear. No matter: playing was for him as necessary as eating and breathing. "That's my therapy," he said after the set, nodding in the direction of the piano as a small smile inched across his half-frozen visage. But in the memorable moments during his set, the large, glistening, ebony B�sendorfer that filled most of Birdland's stage meant something even greater than his personal salvation; for everyone in that room, it became the center of the universe.<br><br>It's a role the piano has enjoyed for over three hundred years: luring music lovers to Parisian salons to hear Chopin's plaintive improvisations, and to Viennese concert halls for Beethoven's ferocious, string-snapping outbursts. The piano captured the spotlight at Harlem "rent parties," where two-fisted ivory "ticklers" worked furiously to outshine each other, and consoled lonely miners in the California Gold Rush as roving European virtuoso Henri Herz performed his variations on "Oh Susannah" [sic] for them. It comforted thousands of Siberian peasants who never had heard a note of classical piano music until Russian master Sviatoslav Richter brought it to their doorsteps. It is still capable of wowing crowds in concert halls, clubs, and stadiums the world over.<br><br>But the piano is more than just an instrument; in the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes, it is a "wondrous box," filled as much with hopes, yearnings, and disappointments as with strings and hammers and felt. It has been a symbol as mutable as the human condition, representing refined elegance in a Victorian home and casual squalor in a New Orleans brothel.<br><br>Consider the gamut of emotions, from elation to dread and even to terror, a performer may face in conquering its technical hurdles, as the young woman in Nobel Prize-winner Elfriede Jelinek's novel The Piano Teacher learned: "She gathers all her energy, spreads her wings, and then plunges forward, toward the keys, which zoom up to her like the earth toward a crashing plane. If she can't reach a note at first swoop, she simply leaves it out. Skipping notes, a subtle vendetta against her musically untrained torturers, gives her a tiny thrill of satisfaction."<br>THE CRUELTY OF THE PIANO-by Piotr Anderszewski<br><br>When I play with orchestra, I sometimes tell myself I'll never play a concerto again. Too many artistic compromises. I only want to do recitals.<br><br>When I'm confronted with the extreme loneliness of the recital, the heroism and also the cruelty involved, I sometimes think that I'll never do recitals ever again. From now on I'll only make recordings.<br><br>When I'm recording and am free to repeat the work as often as I wish, the possibility of doing better, of giving the best possible performance and where everything can turn against me, the piano, the microphone, and above all my own sense of freedom, I think to myself, I'll never go into a recording studio ever again. It's even more cruel. In fact, the ultimate temptation would be to stop everything, lie down, listen to the beat of my heart and quietly wait for it to stop_._._.<br><br>[Yet] sometimes I may not want to play at all, but upon striking the final chord, I say to myself, Something happened here. Something that is completely beyond my control. It's as if the audience had co- created something with me. That's life. Giving is receiving.<br><br>FROM THE BRUNO MONSAINGEON FILM Piotr Anderszewski: Unquiet Traveller<br><br>Nevertheless, the piano can also exert an almost mystical attraction, seducing devotees into lifelong bonds. The magic, when it happens, is inexplicable. Even the technicians who maintain the piano's working parts can seem at times like initiates in a mysterious cult. "A tuner makes a good husband," claims a character in Daniel Mason's novel The Piano Tuner. "He knows how to listen, and his touch is more delicate_._._._Only the tuner knows the inside of the piano."<br><br>Those innards are a miracle of invention. With wood and cast iron, hammers and pivots, weighing altogether nearly a thousand pounds-and capable of sustaining twenty-two tons of tension on its strings (the equivalent of about twenty medium-sized cars)-this majestic contraption will whisper, sing, stutter, or shout at the will of the player. Its tones range from the lowest notes of the orchestra to the highest. It has the remarkable ability to express music of any time period, and in any style-Baroque fugues, Romantic reveries, Impressionist sketches, church hymns, Latin montunos, jazz rhythms, and rock riffs. In the process, it makes everything its own.<br><br>THE WONDER OF THE PIANO by Menahem Pressler<br><br>I was recently asked by Indiana University, where I teach, to select a new piano, and I found one that I felt was exceedingly beautiful. I've chosen many pianos over the years, and most of the time there were some colleagues who complained about my selection, saying, "It's not brilliant enough," or "It's not for chamber music," or "It's not for solo performance." It's like when you choose your mate and someone else says, "I would never have married her." But this time it seemed that I had selected the Marilyn Monroe of pianos-everyone loved it.<br><br>The other night I was playing the Schubert B-flat Sonata on it, and the piano was like a living soul. This was at the end of the day, and I was very tired. And yet I was reminded of what a happy man I am playing on such a piano. You become elated, invigorated, and inspired_._._._all through something built by a factory. It tells me that there is more to life than we can see.<br><br>At birdland, Oscar Peterson again proved the instrument's enduring power. By the end of the evening he had the crowd on its feet, cheering and whistling. It was a special moment, and the audience knew it, the culmination of a unique career, and a last chance to experience the Peterson style, crafted by melding many of the disparate strands that ran through the piano's history. His artistry encompassed them all.<br><br>For dazzling technique, he followed the lessons of the European classical tradition, culled from childhood sessions in his native Canada, first with his sister, Daisy, then with local pianist Louis Hooper and the Hungarian teacher Paul de Marky. He was so serious about his lessons as a young boy that he would practice for up to eighteen hours at a time, he said, on days "when my mother didn't drag me off the stool." De Marky was a good model: he had studied in Budapest with Stefan Thom�n, who had studied with the great Franz Liszt-a musical titan of his day and the founder of modern piano technique.<br><br>Liszt's phenomenal facility-in trademark rapid-fire passages and streams of double notes, along with other exciting displays, such as the quick alternation of hands on the keyboard (which, he explained, he had taken from the music of J. S. Bach)-created such a sensation that poet Heinrich Heine described him in 1844 as "the Attila, the scourge of God." Indeed, claimed Heine, audiences should take pity on the pianos, "which trembled at the news of his coming and now writhe, bleed and wail under his hands, so that the Society for the Protection of Animals should investigate them." Liszt's musical tricks had made many of the breathtaking piano feats of Art Tatum possible. (Peterson was so flabbergasted when he first heard Tatum on record that he almost retired on the spot. "I still feel that way," he admitted that evening at Birdland.)<br><br>De Marky trained Peterson in that great tradition, and assigned the pianist other staples of the repertoire, such as Chopin's treacherously difficult Etudes, along with the "big, rich soft chords" (harmonies, or simultaneously sounding tones) of Claude Debussy. "Oscar is our Liszt and Bill Evans is our Chopin," commented composer Lalo Schifrin, referring to the popular conception that Liszt conquered the piano while Chopin seduced it.<br><br>It's only partly true: the dreamy, impressionist character of a Bill Evans performance does suggest comparisons with the hushed, poetic approach of Chopin, who, according to witnesses, played the instrument using a dynamic range that fell somewhere between a whisper and a murmur. Yet the intricate melodies spun out in an Oscar Peterson solo also owe a great deal to the lyrical genius of Chopin, a composer whose "irregular, black, ascending and descending staircases of notes," wrote critic James Huneker, could "strike the neophyte with terror." And as he taught Peterson, Paul de Marky homed in on Chopin's most important trait. "I don't hear the melody singing," he would tell his student. "The melody is choppy. Make it sing." And so the works of the celebrated classical composers-great improvisers, all-served as his training ground.<br><br>Peterson's immersion in classical studies made him an easy target for some of the jazz crowd. Writer Leonard Feather, using the pseudonym Prof. S. Rosentwig McSiegel, authored a lampoon about a technically astounding pianist named Peter Oscarson who dumbfounded other musicians at a concert by playing a "somewhat esoteric interlude, a set of quadrilles and French-Canadian folk songs." But those studies with de Marky put him in good stead for the artistic heights that would come.<br><br>Paul de Marky's classical expertise notwithstanding, he also encouraged Oscar Peterson's immersion in the jazz canon. "Mr. de Marky was a very great pianist and teacher," remembered Peterson. "What I loved about him was that he was not shortsighted. He was a fantastic classical pianist. But I would come to him for a lesson, and he'd be playing jazz records"-greats like Teddy Wilson, Nat "King" Cole, and Duke Ellington. "Their playing served as my rudiments," he reported.<br><br>He was swept into almost instant fame when producer Norman Granz, visiting Canada, heard him in a live radio broadcast in 1949, and soon after coaxed him into playing in a Jazz at the Philharmonic concert at Carnegie Hall in New York. Introduced as a surprise guest performer, no sooner did he take the stage than, as Mike Levin reported in the magazine DownBeat, the event was stopped "dead cold in its tracks." According to Levin, "he scared some of the local modern minions by playing bop ideas in his left hand_._._._Whereas some of the bop stars conceive good ideas but sweat to make them, Peterson rips them off with an excess of power." Reminiscing about that time, Peterson revealed that he had decided the only way to get attention was "to frighten the hell out of everybody pianistically." He did, and the Peterson-Granz partnership was cemented. The two ended up touring across the continent together, building larger and larger audiences, while battling the pervasive racial prejudice they encountered along the way.<br><br>That American debut helped Peterson move beyond an early reputation as an expert in the rhythmically charged, perpetual- left-hand-motion technique of boogie-woogie. After winning a Canadian amateur contest in the style when he was just fourteen, he became known for a while as "the Brown Bomber of Boogie-Woogie," a takeoff on the nickname given to boxer Joe Louis. ("That was RCA Victor's idea, not mine," Peterson recalled with a glint of anger. "They insisted that I do that. As for whatever name they gave me, I'm happy not to remember.")<br>JAZZ VS. THE CLASSICS<br><br>Oscar Peterson was not, of course, the only jazz great with a classical foundation. Even Louis Armstrong, whose sound seemed hatched from the streets and sporting houses of New Orleans without a hint of European influence, spoke of studying the classics as a child in the city's Colored Waif's Home for Boys. "I played all classical music when I was in the orphanage," he recalled. "That instills the soul in you. You know? Liszt, Bach, Rachmaninoff, Gustav Mahler, and Haydn." Pianist Lil Hardin, who eventually married Armstrong, had been a classical-music major at Nashville's Fisk University before she joined the Creole Jazz Band. She found the transition a bit of a challenge, however. "When I sat down to play," she said, "I asked for the music and were they surprised! They politely told me they didn't have any music and furthermore never used any: I then asked what key would the first number be in. I must have been speaking another language because the leader said, 'When you hear two knocks, just start playing.' " She did, they hired her, and her life as a jazz musician was launched.<br><br>Leonard Feather was just having a little fun with his "Peter Oscarson" portrait. Yet, even today, it's easy to find "experts" guilty of such silly pigeonholing. Ironically, just at the time the "original instrument" movement in classical music was reaching the conclusion that the quest for absolute stylistic authenticity in the performance of early works was futile, the leadership of Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York was attempting to frame the parameters of "authentic" jazz, as if a sort of purity test were possible. But Whitney Balliett got it right when he wrote that jazz was "the sound of surprise." It thrives on unlimited possibility, not hidebound categories.</p><h2>The Hundred Years War, Volume 4: Cursed Kings (The Middle Ages Series)</h2><p><p>Jonathan Sumption's <i>Cursed Kings</i> is the eagerly anticipated fourth volume in what Allan Massie has called "one of the great historical works of our time."</p><p><i>Cursed Kings</i> tells the story of the destruction of France by the madness of its king and the greed and violence of his family. In the early fifteenth century France, Europe's strongest and most populous state, suffered a complete internal collapse. As the warring parties within fought for the spoils of the kingdom under the vacant gaze of the mad King Charles VI, the country was left at the mercy of one of the most remarkable rulers of the European Middle Ages: Henry V of England, who had destroyed the French army on the field of Agincourt in October 1415 and left most of France's leadership dead.</p><p>Sumption recounts in extraordinary detail the relentless campaign of conquest that brought Henry to the streets and palaces of Paris within just a few years. He died at the age of thirty-six in a French royal castle in 1422, just two months before he would have become king of France.</p><p>Six centuries later, these extraordinary events are overlaid by the resounding words of Shakespeare and the potent national myths of England and France.

As we develop into adults, it becomes easy to lose touch with these crucial mind-body communication channels, but they are essential to our ability to navigate social interactions and deal with psychological stress, physical injury, and trauma.

Porges, PhD, author of <em>The Polyvagal Theory</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;With self-help exercises, case vignettes, neuroscience research, and more, this creative, interactive book provides a sophisticated yet down-to-earth perspective on what Fogel calls &#x201c;embodied self-awareness.&#x201d; Readable, wise, lucid, simple and engaging, <em>Body Sense</em> is a timely and valuable contribution to the field.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Pat Ogden, PhD, Founder/Director of the Sensorimotor Psychotherapy Institute</strong><br><br>&#x201c;The field of what has been termed somatic psychology has burgeoned in the past two decades. In <em>Body Sense: The Science and Practice of Embodied Self-Awareness</em>, psychologist and therapeutic body worker Alan Fogel has highlighted the neurophysiological underpinnings of body-based therapy by offering us an accessible but encyclopedic presentation of how the brain and body work together to create self-awareness. He makes a powerful case for therapists to enlist clients&#x2019; body state perceptions in order to clear the mental and emotional debris that accompanies trauma. Fogel&#x2019;s use of science and compelling clinical case studies to illustrate his ideas make this a unique and dynamic contribution to the field.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robert Scaer, MD, Author of <em>The Trauma Spectrum</em> and <em>8 Keys to Brain-Body Balance</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;It is a truly revolutionary act to render our vague, instinctual knowledge about the body and self-awareness into something understandable, urgent, and applicable to everyday life. In so doing, Alan Fogel has laid a solid and comprehensive foundation for far-reaching changes in psychotherapy, medicine, and our daily lives.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Daniel N. Stern, MD, author of <em>The Interpersonal World of the Infant</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This book is a rare work in its crossing of two worlds: the intricate, technical world of psychological and biomedical research, with its increasingly sophisticated technologies and languages; and the lived world of becoming mature adults. Alan Fogel succeeds in weaving together these disparate worlds with his lucid writing grounded in his thorough understanding both of the importance of embodied self-awareness in our ordinary lives and the sciences that make sense of that dimension of our being. It is an eminently practical book, providing many clues for how we might expand the benefits of embodiment in negotiating the challenges of our lives and, at the same time, gain a familiarity with the scientific basis for their efficacy, thus counteracting inevitable tendencies toward self-doubt and cynicism.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Don Hanlon Johnson, PhD, professor of somatics, CIIS and author of Everyday Hopes, Utopian Dreams: Reflections on American Ideals</strong></p><h2>Jews and Muslims in British Colonial America: A Genealogical History</h2><p>Americans have learned in elementary school that their country was founded by a group of brave, white, largely British Christians. Modern reinterpretations recognize the contributions of African and indigenous Americans, but the basic premise has persisted. This groundbreaking study fundamentally challenges the traditional national storyline by postulating that many of the initial colonists were actually of Sephardic Jewish and Muslim Moorish ancestry. Supporting references include historical writings, ship manifests, wills, land grants, DNA test results, genealogies, and settler lists that provide for the first time the Spanish, Hebrew, Arabic, and Jewish origins of more than 5,000 surnames, the majority widely assumed to be British. By documenting the widespread presence of Jews and Muslims in prominent economic, political, financial and social positions in all of the original colonies, this innovative work offers a fresh perspective on the early American experience.</p><p>In America, unlike Britain, it is not true that "only the eminent have anything like a genealogy."&nbsp;Genealogy in this country is the second most popular hobby after gardening. We are assured, and it stands to reason, that every individual no matter how elusive or obscure left some evidence of their existence in public records. More and more, the genealogies compiled and published forsake the manufactured Lives of Great Men to include maternal connections, ordinary folk and minorities. With the emerging tools of the Internet it is possible to be both thorough and accurate and produce detailed genealogies motivated by a desire for gathering facts, for telling the truth and for redressing some of the injustices of traditional, orthodox accounts. The footnotes in this study are intended not only to document origins and surname histories in unequivocal fashion but also to cast a sidelight on celebrated Jewish Americans who can trace back to colonial forebears and their relatives in European Jewry. These range from the Massachusetts Kennedys to the Byrds of Virginia, from actors Johnny Depp and Adrien Brody to actresses Roseanne Barr and Gwyneth Paltrow, from writers Louise Gl�ck and Neil Simon to politicians Barbara Boxer and Bernie Sanders and jurists Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. As biased and purpose-made genealogies recede into the background, privileged historical theses with vested interests must also be on the defensive. We hope that the remarkable stories of the men, women and families here will serve as a reminder of America's early diversity and stimulus for rewriting some of the inaccurate and injudicious portions in the proud chronicle of her birth and formative years.<br> <br>Elizabeth Caldwell Hirschman is a professor of marketing at the University of Virginia-Wise.

The goal of the textbook is to provide a thorough overview of the features, principles, processes, and structures underlying the working of the human nervous system. The textbook is designed to provide students with the neuroanatomical and physiological content relevant to CSD applications, and also content that places these features into the context of a behaving and communicative human.<p> <b>Key Features:</b> </p><li>An emphasis on fundamental information on anatomy, neurophysiological, and functional processes using a conversational writing style.</li> <li>Beautifully illustrated with full-color anatomical and component figures, photographs, schematic line drawings, process flow-charts, and tables.</li> <li>Three chapters on the neural bases of speech, language, and hearing help integrate the basic information from earlier chapters with findings specific to CSD.</li> <li>Each chapter begins with an introduction and learning objectives and ends with review questions and a top ten summary list.</li> <li>Bolded key terms throughout with a glossary of definitions for comprehension.</li> <li>Clinical Importance Boxes highlight clinically relevant disorders and syndromes that compliment topic coverage.</li> <li>Interesting Facts Boxes highlight interesting, fun, and quirky facts about the nervous systems structure, physiology, and functionality.</li> <li>A PluralPlus companion website with PowerPoint lecture slides, instructional videos, and a sample syllabus for instructors, and interactive quizzes and flashcards for students.</li> <i>Neuroscience Fundamentals for Communication Sciences and Disorders</i> includes several chapters on broad topics related to brain and behavior relationships such as learning, skill acquisition, attention and memory, emotion, and neuroplasticity. These chapters go beyond typical neuroanatomy content to cover the large scale concepts that CSD students need to internalize to understand how humans learn, how and why we behave, and how these concepts apply to communication disorders. Such an understanding will deepen the student's appreciation of the critical relevance of CSD in life and the importance of treatment to regain effective communication after disease, injury, or as a function of disorder.</p><p>Richard D.

But the guide mysteriously disappears, leaving them to sail to Thebes to follow his trail. The fact that Ramses and Nefret are along on the journey both helps and hampers efforts to solve this mystery. Soon all four are risking their lives as they foil kidnappers, grave robbers and ancient curses. And intrepid Amelia finds herself faced with a surprising new villain who is every bit as clever and resourceful as she is!</p><p>What could be more intriguing to Amelia Peabody and her irresistible, irascible husband, Emerson (&#34;the Father of Curses&#34;), than meeting a masked stranger who offers to show them an Egyptian queen&#39;s lost tomb? The mysterious disappearance of that midnight visitor before he can disclose the secret! Thus begins Amelia&#39;s newest adventure along the Nile. Helped, or hampered, by two teenagers, their son, Ramses, and their beautiful ward, Nefret, the Emersons set sail for Thebes to find the hidden tomb of Queen Tetisheri. With them is a timid (or is she?) governess named Miss Marmaduke. Soon to join the expedition are Amelia&#39;s sister- and brother-in-law, Evelyn and Walter, whose marriage is going through a rocky patch. As usual, archaeology is only one of Amelia&#39;s concerns, as the Emersons encounter murderers, kidnappers, grave robbers and ancient Egyptian curses. The tomb, of course, will hold a stunning surprise. And the Hippopotamus Pool? It&#39;s an ancient Egyptian story of war and wits that Amelia is translating... and that alerts her to a hippo of a different stripe: a nefarious, overweight art dealer who may become her next archenemy. Or perhaps not - for another nemesis is lurking under the Saharan sun, a master of disguises, a caliph of crime, a veritable vizier of villainy.

Human Nature eviscerates these and other doctrines of a contemporary nihilism masquerading as science. In this wide-ranging work polymath David Berlinski draws upon history, mathematics, logic, and literature to retrain our gaze on an old truth many are eager to forget: there is and will be about the human condition beauty, nobility, and moments of sublime insight, yes, but also ignorance and depravity. Men are not about to become like gods.</p><p>Bestselling author David Berlinski holds a PhD from Princeton University and has taught philosophy and mathematics at universities in France and the United States.

He lives in Paris, France.<p>&#x201c;Polymath David Berlinski&#x2019;s appraisal of a transcendent human nature is really a military history, a discourse on physics and mathematics, a review of philosophy and linguistics, and a brilliant indictment of scientific groupthink by an unapologetic intellectual dissident.

His ability to use science and mathematics to illuminate history is nearly unique. If I were assembling a list of essential modern books for undergraduates at my college or any college, this book would be number one.

Few writers indeed, about science or society, can boast such a thoroughgoing command of the significant ideas of the past century, the confident mastery of every centrally significant scientific theory. Yet if Berlinski derives obvious joy from the great theories that unify the world, he is never more memorable than when he vividly displays its irreducible particulars, holding the quiddities of place and person more clearly before our imagination than we might even see them ourselves.</p><p>Indeed, if Berlinski glories in science&#x2019;s achievements, he is no less dismissive of those attempts to see pattern and abstraction born not of vision but of ignorance; and he repeatedly marshals his exceptionally deep historical and scientific knowledge (and his inimitable wit) to drive facile theories of man and the world into the shoals. He is a relentless and devastating enemy of all attempts to reduce the tragic, bizarre, glorious world that confronts us to simple answers or easy slogans at the expense of the facts.

And Anansi, that cunning little spider, was determined to buy them back. The payment? A live python, one real fairy, and forty-seven stinging hornets. Not such a high price to pay for all the folktales on earth. But how will Anansi find these hard to come bgy items? It sounds impossible! There&#39;s only one way to find the help he needs -- Anansi must go to his clever wife, Aso. But will she be smart enough to outwit the Sky God and get the stories back? This humorous retelling of an Ashanti tale brings Anansi together with his better half in an ingenious scheme that will delight readers of all ages!</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 3. Anansi the Spider is determined to buy back the stories taken from the people and kept by the Sky God. With the assistance of his clever wife, Aso, he takes the Sky God the live python, the real fairy, and the 47 stinging hornets required to regain the stories. Retold from Aardema's The Sky God Stories (Coward, 1960; o.p.), the tale rollicks along at a rhythmic merry pace, full of descriptive ideophones (sounds that express movement or emotion). The lively narrative is perfect for reading aloud, and the inclusion of Aso is a particularly nice touch. Desimini's textured collages portray the spider couple as cheeky and cherubic in their boldly patterned clothing. The extravagant, vibrant illustrations fill the pages and complement the text beautifully. The depictions of the defiant Anansi confronting the Sky God, a gigantic, disembodied head, are particularly effective. Gail Haley's A Story, A Story (Atheneum, 1970) tells the same tale, but to compare the two would be to compare apples and oranges. Both retellings have lively, evocative language, although Aardema's version may be more suited to preschool listeners, and both have compelling illustrations that extend and illuminate the narrative.

The good ones bring peace, joy and power into our lives, and the bad ones steal our peace and joy and prevent our success. In this book, Joyce Meyer explains how to develop good habits--the things you really want to do--and break the bad ones, putting an end to frustration, discouragement and stress that drains your energy. <br><br>The most important habit comes first: the God habit. Next comes a willingness to work for the results you want. Joyce reminds us that, "if we don't pay the price for freedom, we will end up paying the price for bondage". Next comes the power of our words. Our words and the thoughts that propel them have tremendous power over our actions, and repeated actions are the basis of our habits.<br><br> There are eleven more habits that Joyce discusses in depth, including the habits of happiness, faith, excellence, responsibility, generosity, discipline, decisiveness and confidence. <br><br> "Choose one area and begin," she urges. "Don't feel overwhelmed by all the changes that are needed. One thing at a time, one day at a time is the best plan. Celebrate every day of success, and when you make mistakes, shake off the disappointment and keep going forward."<br><br>You can transform your life, one habit at a time. <br><br></p><p>Joyce Meyer is one of the world's leading practical Bible teachers.

An uneasy peace is about to be shattered as France&#x2019;s greatest living general prepares an invasion force in Toulon; but where is it bound? Captain Carlisle hails from Virginia, a loyal colony of the British Crown. As the clouds of war gather, Carlisle&#x2019;s small frigate &#x2014; Fury &#x2014; is ordered to Toulon on a reconnaissance mission. If battling the winter weather in the Gulf of Lions is not a sufficient challenge, Carlisle must also juggle the delicate diplomatic issues in this period of pre-war tension while contending with an increasingly belligerent French frigate. But Carlisle has additional problems unique to his colonial origins: he has no professional or political sponsors and an uninspiring group of followers, both of which are essential to a mid-eighteenth century naval career. How can a penniless second son from Virginia overcome these crippling deficiencies? George Holbrooke, Carlisle&#x2019;s reluctant master&#x2019;s mate, cannot disguise his lack of enthusiasm for the tedium of the peacetime navy. His attitude changes as he experiences combat and personal danger, but can he persuade his captain that he has turned the corner? And can he achieve that vital promotion to commissioned status? And then there is the beautiful Chiara Angelini, pursued across the Mediterranean by a Tunisian corsair who appears determined to abduct her, yet reluctant to shed blood. Can Carlisle solve this mystery and protect Chiara? Fury shadows the French fleet as it sails from Toulon and reveals its true destination. Carlisle and Holbrooke are witnesses to the inconclusive sea-battle which leads to the loss of Minorca and engage in a thrilling and bloody final encounter with the French frigate. The Colonial Post-Captain is the first in a planned series of novels that will follow Carlisle and Holbrooke through the Seven Years War and into the period of turbulent relations between Britain and her American colonies in the 1760s. Edward Carlisle is a near-contemporary and colonial neighbour of the founding fathers of American independence. He will negotiate some interesting loyalty issues when British policy and colonial restlessness lead inexorably to the American Revolution.</p><p></p><h2>The Crown Jewel Mystery: A Sherlock Holmes and Lucy James Story (A Sherlock Holmes and Lucy James Mystery)</h2><p>This novella is the prequel to <em>The Sherlock Holmes and Lucy James Mystery</em> series.

That debate led to ground-breaking court decisions and major shifts in corporate policies that have had a profound effect on our lives--and on Anita Hill's life. Now, with remarkable insight and total candor, Anita Hill reflects on events before, during, and after the hearings, offering for the first time a complete account that sheds startling new light on this watershed event.<br><br>Only after reading her moving recollection of her childhood on her family's Oklahoma farm can we fully appreciate the values that enabled her to withstand the harsh scrutiny she endured during the hearings and for years afterward. Only after reading her detailed narrative of the Senate Judiciary proceedings do we reach a new understanding of how Washington--and the media--rush to judgment. And only after discovering the personal toll of this wrenching ordeal, and how Hill copes, do we gain new respect for this extraordinary woman.<br><br>Here is a vitally important work that allows us to understand why Anita Hill did what she did, and thereby brings resolution to one of the most controversial episodes in our nation's history.</p><p>In 1991, Anita Hill, a law professor, dropped a bombshell into the middle of Senate Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas: Thomas had, Hill alleged, harassed and embarrassed her with repeated requests for dates and discussions about pornography while supervising her at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hill's allegations introduced a volatile mix of sex, race, and scandal into the proceedings, deeply dividing both the Senate and the entire country. The aftermath of the Thomas hearings saw plenty of books about Anita Hill--some supporting her, others attacking--but Hill remained silent... until now. In <i>Speaking Truth to Power</i>, Anita Hill finally sets the record straight.<p> Though much of the book details her side of the story and her professional relationship with Clarence Thomas, <i>Speaking Truth to Power</i> also provides interesting glimpses into Anita Hill, the person. From her early life as the youngest of 13 children on a farm in Oklahoma to her current position as a law professor, Hill offers details about her personal life and her motivations. Hill writes with forthright conviction; in this case of he said/she said, <i>Speaking Truth to Power</i> tilts the scales a little more heavily in Anita Hill's favor.</p>My world has been forever changed by the events that culminated in the "Hill-Thomas hearing" six years ago. I am no longer an anonymous, private individual, and my name has become synonymous with sexual harassment. To many I represent the courage to come forward and disclose a painful truth--a courage which thousands of others have found for themselves since the hearings. To others I represent the debasement of the public forum, at best a pawn, at worst a perjurer.<p>But I am no longer content to leave the assessment to others, for they cannot know what I experienced--what I felt, saw, heard, and thought. Whatever others may say, I must address these questions for myself. I did not choose the issue of sexual harassment; it chose me. And, having been chosen, I have come to believe that it is up to me to try and give meaning to it all.</p><p>--Anita Hill</p><p></p></p><h2>Five o&#39;clock Charlie</h2><p>Charlie's not old!

Lifelong Californian Michele Anna Jordan is, according to Mollie Katzen, &#34;the quintessential expert on California cuisine&#34; and first channeled this expertise into the successful book, California Home Cooking. Since then, she has been perfecting her salad-making craft over several decades as a chef, caterer, food columnist, and cookbook author. In Vinaigrettes and Other Dressings, she shares her wisdom about the most critical component in any salad: its dressing. About half of the recipes in Vinaigrettes and Other Dressings are riffs on the classic vinegar-and-olive-oil vinaigrette. But Michele take the formula in surprising and delicious directions, sometimes by using flavored vinegars (either store-bought or flavored by the home cook), sometimes by using dark vs. light or mild vs. strong olive oils, sometimes by switching out the olive oil for another oil, and always by adding flavoring elements like berries, citrus, honey, bacon, nuts, mustard and even wines and sherries (There is a whole art to selecting the right wines to make a given dressing, and the California-bred Jordan has the perfect skills here, too.). The remaining recipes include: milk- or cream-based dressings, dressings that start with a base of finely pureed fruits or vegetables, and dressings that feature a distinctively flavored oil, such as walnut oil or hazelnut oil. While the emphasis is on dressings for green salads and which greens pair best with each dressing, there are ample ideas for other uses, such as green bean, potato, and other veggie salads, as well as fruit salads and dinner salads that include meats or fish. The recipes will be accompanied by colorful photographs, and plenty of tips to guide the home cook&#39;s creativity in the kitchen.</p><p>Michele Anna Jordan, a second-generation Californian who has lived in the San Francisco Bay Area her entire lif has twelve years of experience as an award-winning chef and has written a multitude of cookbooks.

The luminous Italian movie star was the first artist to win an Oscar for a foreign language performance, after which she continued a vibrant and varied career that took her from Hollywood to Paris to Italy&#x2014;and back to Hollywood. In <i>Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow</i>, Loren shares vivid memories of work, love, and family with winning candor.<br> <br>Born in 1934 and growing up in World War II Italy, Loren&#x2019;s life of glamour and success was preceded by years of poverty and hardship, when she lived in her grandparents&#x2019; house with her single mother and sister, and endured near starvation. She shares how she blossomed from a toothpick-thin girl into a beautiful woman seemingly overnight, getting her start by winning a beauty pageant; and how her first Hollywood film, <i>The Pride and the Passion</i>, ignited a high-profile romance with Cary Grant, who would vie with her mentor, friend, frequent producer, and lover Carlo Ponti to become her husband. Loren also reveals her long-held desire to become a mother, the disappointments she suffered, the ultimate joy of having two sons, and her happiness as a mother and grandmother.<br> <br>From trying times to triumphant ones, this scintillating autobiography paints a multi-dimensional portrait of the woman behind the celebrity, beginning each chapter with a letter, photograph, or object that prompts her memories.

I leave the dough to rest and hurry to open the door, my hands covered in flour, wiping them as best I can on my apron.<br> <br>The florist, behind a huge poinsettia, hints at a smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;For you, Signora Loren. Can I get your autograph, please?&#x201d;<br> <br>The label on the ribbon takes me back to Italy for an instant. I put the plant down on the piece of furniture and open the card. It conveys an affectionate, cheerful thought.<br> <br>The voices of my grandchildren, who have just arrived from the United States for the holidays, fill the house with excitement and chaos. Tomorrow is Christmas Eve and we&#x2019;ll finally all be together. The truth is, though, that I&#x2019;m not ready. How will I manage to feed so many people? How can I possibly fry all those struffoli?<br> <br>The world whirls around me dizzily and I feel as if everything is slipping out of my control. I go back to the kitchen, in search of certainties that I can&#x2019;t find. I head into the dining room, hoping that things will go better there. The table! Yes, the dinner table for tomorrow. I want it colorful and beautiful. In a frenzy, I take out the glasses and arrange the plates and cutlery. I fold the napkins carefully. I have fun deciding who will sit where.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m a Virgo and, most days, I even manage to bore myself with my compulsive perfectionism, but not today. Today it looks like the messiness is getting the upper hand. I start over again on the table, trying to keep my emotions at bay. Let&#x2019;s see, two, four, eight, plus five, thirteen, and four makes seventeen guests for dinner tomorrow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, not seventeen, that&#x2019;s an unlucky number! Let me count over again.<br> <br>From the photograph of him on the chiffonier, Carlo is smiling that special smile of his on our wedding day. I&#x2019;ll never forget the first time I felt his eyes on me, many years before, in a restaurant with a view of the Colosseum. I was not much more than a young girl, and he was already a successful man. The waiter came over to me with a note from him saying that the producer had noticed me. Then the stroll in the garden, the roses, the scent of acacia, summer as it was coming to a close. That was the start of my adventure.<br> <br>I stroke the green armchair where Carlo would doze off while reading the newspaper. I feel cold; I must remember to light the fire tomorrow. Luckily, Beatrice, the youngest of my grandchildren, comes along to take my mind off my recollections. &#x201c;Nonna Sophia, Nonna Sophia!&#x201d; She&#x2019;s very blond&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and very determined. Behind her, the others peer in, like a delegation of little rascals. It&#x2019;s time to get ready to go to bed, but they have no intention of doing so. I look at them, they smile at me, we make a deal.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we see a movie?&#x201d;<br> <br>Amid shouts of joy, a battle breaks out as they choose which cartoon movie to watch. In the end Cars 2 wins, their favorite of the moment. We all sit down together in front of the TV.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nonna, can you imitate Mamma Topolino for us?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Now, mangia. Eat!&#x201d; I recite my line from Cars 2, making funny faces as I do so.<br> <br>&#x201c;Again, again, Nonna, please. Do it again!&#x201d;<br> <br>Hearing my voice, the same that comes from the mouth of a little car, drives them wild. Who would have thought they would enjoy it so much when I accepted, rather reluctantly, the proposal to do that peculiar dubbing job?<br> <br>Little by little, Vittorio and Lucia, Leo, and Beatrice are mesmerized by the movie and, before it&#x2019;s over, they&#x2019;re fast asleep. I cover them with a blanket, look at my watch, and think about tomorrow. Outside it&#x2019;s started to snow, but with all the hustle and bustle inside I hadn&#x2019;t even noticed.<br> <br>Comings and goings are always very special moments. They set the merry-go-round of recollections in motion, opening doors to yesterday, today, and tomorrow.<br> <br>When I think back on my life, sometimes I&#x2019;m surprised that it&#x2019;s actually all true. I say to myself, One morning, I&#x2019;ll wake up and find out that it&#x2019;s all just a dream. Not that it was always easy. There were hard times. But it was definitely wonderful and worthwhile. Success, too, bears its burden that you have to learn how to cope with. No one can teach you. The answer is inside you, where all answers are.<br> <br>I tiptoe back to my bedroom. It&#x2019;s comforting to spend some time alone. I know that if I stop for a moment of quiet, I can find the peaceful beating of my heart, and calm.<br> <br>As soon as I&#x2019;m in the bedroom I realize I&#x2019;m still wearing my apron. I untie it, take off my shoes, and slump onto the bed; the magazine I&#x2019;d been reading in the morning is still open to the same page. The excitement of embracing my family again has made it hard for me to sleep these past few nights, and I feel lost if I don&#x2019;t sleep. It&#x2019;s the engine that helps me to travel through my days.<br> <br>&#x201c;Buon riposo!&#x201d; (Good night!), Ninni shouts out from the other room. &#x201c;Cerchi di dormire!&#x201d; (Try to get some rest!)<br> <br>Ninni, Ninni&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she&#x2019;s been with us for nearly fifty years. She was Carlo Jr. and Edoardo&#x2019;s Nanny, and when they grew up she stayed on to take care of me. Now, whenever my sons come to the city with their children, she takes care of those little rascals with the same enthusiasm as ever. Sometimes I wonder where she finds the patience to put up with us.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sto gi� dormendo&#x201d; (I&#x2019;m already half asleep), I tell her to reassure her. But instead of sleeping I just lie there, my eyes wide open as I stare at the ceiling.<br> <br>As I try to calm down, thoughts race through my mind. Will my grandchildren like my struffoli? The ones that my Zia Rachelina would make for us in Pozzuoli, the small town where I grew up, were much better than mine. You know, the flavors of our childhood are always better than others.<br> <br>I feel restless, the way you do when you slowly slip from reality to a different world, one of dreams or memories. I can&#x2019;t keep still, so I put on my bathrobe and go into the study at the end of the hall. To do what, I don&#x2019;t know. I look at the shelf, I move aside some books, bric-a-brac, pictures, paperweights. I fret, as if I&#x2019;m looking for something. Then I see a dark wooden box at the back of the shelf. My heart skips a beat. It takes me by surprise, but I recognize it right away. In an instant, I pull it down and open it. Before my eyes are letters, telegrams, notes, photographs. That&#x2019;s what was pulling me here; this is the thread that guided my footsteps on this cold winter night.<br> <br>The wooden box holds my treasure trove of memories. I&#x2019;m tempted to leave it as it is. Too much time has passed, too many emotions. But then I muster the courage to pick it up, and I slowly carry it back to the bedroom.<br> <br>Maybe this is my Christmas gift, and it&#x2019;s up to me to open it.</p><h2>Fighting Fantasy City Of Thieves</h2><p>PART STORY, PART GAME - PURE ADVENTURE!

Indeed, therapists and lawyers have created an industry based on treating and litigating the cases of people who suddenly claim to have "recovered" memories of everything from child abuse to murder.</p><p>This book reveals that despite decades of research, there is absolutely no controlled scientific support for the idea that memories of trauma are routinely banished into the unconscious and then reliably recovered years later. Since it is not actually a legitimate psychological phenomenon, the idea of "recovered memory"--and the movement that has developed alongside it--is thus closer to a dangerous fad or trendy witch hunt.</p></p><p><p><b>Dr. Elizabeth Loftus,</b> a professor of psychology at the University of Washington, is also the author of <i>Witness for the Defense</i> and <i>Eyewitness Testimony</i>.</p><p><b>Katherine Ketcham</b> is also the co-author of <i>Under the Influence</i>, <i>The Spirituality of Imperfection</i>, <i>Beyond the Influence</i>, <i>The Power of Empathy</i>, and other books.</p>A research psychologist whose specialty is memory pokes giant holes in claims that survivors of sexual abuse repress their memories of the abuse and can then recover them with the help of therapists. Loftus, who also teamed up with Ketcham to write Witness for the Defense (1991), points out that no scientific evidence exists to validate such claims. Comparing the current rash of sex abuse charges based on ``recovered memory'' to the 17th-century Salem witchcraft trials, she often opens chapters with quotes from The Crucible, Arthur Miller's play on that subject. Loftus describes her own research at the University of Washington, which found that false memories of a mildly traumatic childhood event (becoming lost in a large store, for example) were easily implanted in the minds of adult subjects. According to Loftus, therapists operating under the assumption that ``incest is epidemic, repression is rampant, recovery is possible, and therapy can help,'' implant similarly false memories of more serious traumas through a variety of therapeutic techniques, including suggestive questioning, age regression, and hypnosis. Memories ``recovered'' through these techniques, she asserts, can lead to painful and destructive confrontations that rip apart families and sometimes end in prison sentences for innocent people. Loftus, who has served as an expert witness, recounts her experience testifying in defense of George Franklin, whose adult daughter's recovered memories resulted in his conviction for the murder of one of the daughter's childhood friends. She also details the bizarre case of Paul Ingram (see Lawrence Wright's Remembering Satan, p. 216), whose recovered memories led him to confess to participation in quite unbelievable satanic rituals. Sure to arouse controversy: Proponents of the validity of repressed memories (``True Believers,'' as Loftus calls them) will see this as anathema; others will applaud her reasonable and restrained approach to a touchy subject.

Eventually the doctor pulled out a picture of a dog&#x2014;a spotted dalmatian&#x2014;and showed it to him. &#x201c;Now close your eyes and try to picture this dog in your head,&#x201d; he instructed Owen.<br> <br>Owen nodded. But once his eyes closed, he frowned, realizing he couldn&#x2019;t bring an image of the dog into his mind. It was like there was a complete blank. He could remember words describing the dog, like &#x201c;dalmatian,&#x201d; &#x201c;spotted,&#x201d; &#x201c;tail,&#x201d; and &#x201c;paws,&#x201d; but for whatever reason, he couldn&#x2019;t build an image using those words. He opened his eyes again, a bit confused, and stared harder at the photo. This shouldn&#x2019;t be that difficult. He could see it clearly, right there in front of him. This wasn&#x2019;t complicated.<br> <br>Owen shut his eyes again, knowing he could do this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and came up blank.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t picture it,&#x201d; he said, wondering why he didn&#x2019;t feel more frustrated.<br> <br>&#x201c;The technical term for what&#x2019;s happening to you is aphantasia,&#x201d; the doctor said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve lost the ability to visualize anything in your head. Basically, your imagination doesn&#x2019;t exist anymore. But don&#x2019;t let it worry you. I can&#x2019;t imagine it&#x2019;ll affect your life too much.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s odd,&#x201d; Owen&#x2019;s mother said, raising one eyebrow. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s always had an active imagination. But ever since he disappeared for a few days and then turned up in London, he&#x2019;s been acting different.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just him,&#x201d; the doctor said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen it in people all over town, from kids to adults to the elderly. It happened to me, even.&#x201d; He showed Owen&#x2019;s mother the picture. &#x201c;Most likely you, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>As his mom went through the same test, Owen stared off into space, feeling strangely calm. Losing his imagination seemed like it should worry him. But it didn&#x2019;t really feel that bad, like the doctor said. So he couldn&#x2019;t picture a dog in his head. It wasn&#x2019;t like that came up too often. And really, what was he using his imagination for anyway? Wasting time in school? Making up things that didn&#x2019;t exist? Nothing important, in other words.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t picture it either, you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; his mother said, opening her eyes. &#x201c;So is there a cure?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cure?&#x201d; the doctor said, blinking in confusion. &#x201c;Of course not. This is just how things are now. I can&#x2019;t imagine us ever coming up with a fix.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, as long as it&#x2019;s healthy and normal,&#x201d; his mother said, smiling at the doctor. &#x201c;If Owen&#x2019;s okay, we should be going. My shift starts soon at the library.&#x201d;<br> <br>The doctor wrinkled his nose. &#x201c;Does anyone even come in anymore?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, but we&#x2019;re bringing in more nonfiction,&#x201d; his mother said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all anyone&#x2019;s been checking out lately anyway.&#x201d;<br> <br>On the way to the library, Owen went over the assignments he would have turned in that day in school. Everything seemed correct to him, but he went over them a second time, just to be sure. Math was a subject to be taken very seriously, according to adults, and he trusted their judgment.<br> <br>They arrived at the library a few minutes after Owen started his math assignment over, so he sadly placed his papers in the textbook, marking his spot. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you get your London punishment out of the way first?&#x201d; his mother said. &#x201c;That way you can enjoy your schoolwork as a reward.&#x201d;<br> <br>That seemed logical. After Owen had spent a few days away from home, first in Jupiter City and then trapped with Kara Dox in a time prison, his mother had gone a bit insane, contacting every police station and hospital within four states. But as soon as Owen called her from London, she immediately calmed down and arranged for him to fly back.<br> <br>He hadn&#x2019;t expected that, honestly, but now knowing that she had no imagination helped explain things: She literally couldn&#x2019;t imagine him ever returning while he was missing, so had completely lost it. But now that he was back, she couldn&#x2019;t picture him leaving again, so his punishment was more about the principle.<br> <br>She did ask where he&#x2019;d been, though, and he obviously told the truth: He&#x2019;d been helping Bethany, who was half-fictional, find her missing father in a superhero comic, only to be thrown into a Pick the Plot book by a fictional man named Nobody, who had then separated the fictional and nonfictional worlds and sent Owen and Bethany back to the nonfictional world through the last open portal between their worlds, the one that led to Neverland. And since that portal connected to London, that&#x2019;s where they emerged.<br> <br>She seemed a bit confused by some of the explanation, but couldn&#x2019;t imagine any other way he could have gotten to London, so accepted his story. Logic dictated that he should be punished for his actions, so in spite of not being able to picture him ever repeating his crimes, she and Bethany&#x2019;s mother had agreed on a punishment: Bethany and Owen would help Owen&#x2019;s mother in her library every night for a year.<br> <br>That didn&#x2019;t seem that bad to Owen, since that&#x2019;s what he did most nights anyway. And now he had an excuse to hang out with Bethany every evening, doing homework or quizzing each other on facts they could memorize. All in all, it was a pretty pleasant punishment.<br> <br>What wasn&#x2019;t pleasant, though, was having to deal with the books at the library. As his mother had said, almost no one came in anymore, so Owen and Bethany ended up spending most of their time clearing fiction books off the shelves to make room for more nonfiction.<br> <br>Not that Owen could blame them: Though he&#x2019;d once spent most of his time reading, now whenever Owen tried to read his old favorite books, he couldn&#x2019;t picture the stories in his head. Without an imagination, he was just reading words, not seeing any characters or situations.<br> <br>But like the doctor had said, was that really a bad thing? Now he had so much more time for the nonfictional world, and for performing tasks that he was given to the best of his abilities. What better way to get ahead in life than that? Owen couldn&#x2019;t imagine anything.<br> <br>And making room for nonfictional books in the library was easy enough. Spike, his fictional cat, sat in the empty spaces in the bookshelves, periodically jumping up to a higher one just to get a better look. Every so often Spike would meow, and Owen would pet him, which always made him miss his fictional friends for some reason, and he&#x2019;d wonder what they were doing and where they were now. Were they fighting back against Nobody still? Or had they given up, since things weren&#x2019;t really that bad with the worlds separated?<br> <br>Weirdly, he only seemed to think about them while petting Spike. That made sense, though, since Spike was fictional himself, and logically he&#x2019;d remind Owen of other fictionals.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; said a voice from behind him as Owen scratched Spike&#x2019;s head. He turned around to find Bethany standing there with a worried look on her face as all thoughts of his fictional friends seemed to drain from his mind. &#x201c;Are you okay? I felt so bad that you missed school today!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; Owen said, shrugging. &#x201c;Apparently something&#x2019;s going around. I&#x2019;ll be there tomorrow and can catch up on anything I missed.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bethany&#x2019;s face lit up as she dropped a bag of textbooks into his lap. &#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t worry! I brought you everything we went over today. I can help you catch up right now.&#x201d; She beamed at him.<br> <br>He returned her smile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re way too nice to me, you know that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no such thing,&#x201d; she said, patting him on the shoulder. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re my best friend. I&#x2019;m just looking out for you. Besides, after everything the fictional me put you through, I owe you for years.&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen nodded, not wanting to argue the point again. Ever since they&#x2019;d returned, Bethany had decided that her fictional self had been the part of her that had caused all of her problems, from jumping her father into a book in the first place, to getting them kidnapped by Fowen&#x2014;Owen&#x2019;s fictional self&#x2014;to losing Owen to Nobody in Jupiter City. Owen didn&#x2019;t really see how that made sense, but arguing with her about it didn&#x2019;t seem to help, so he&#x2019;d just let it go.<br> <br>&#x201c;That wasn&#x2019;t your fault, you know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I could have said no each time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I shouldn&#x2019;t have put you in that position. If I just hadn&#x2019;t given in to my fictional half over and over, none of it would have happened. It makes me so angry&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&#x201d; She paused and took a deep breath, then slowly let it out. &#x201c;Sorry, I need to stop blaming her. Every time I do, I try to remember Gwen, EarthGirl. She never thought one bad thing about me, no matter how many mistakes I made. Thinking of her helps remind me not to judge myself so harshly.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She was pretty great,&#x201d; Owen agreed. &#x201c;You know who I miss the most?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bethany shrugged. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t even imagine.&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen started to say a name, then stopped. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t really matter. We should get back to work. Mom wants us to finish the kids&#x2019; section tonight before we study.&#x201d; He nodded at the books piled behind him. &#x201c;Do you want to start at the back of the alphabet, and I&#x2019;ll take the front?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold up just a moment there, you two,&#x201d; said a deep, booming voice. A man easily seven feet tall strode over to them carrying a box full of books. The man&#x2019;s muscles bulged out of his tailored black suit, and he walked strangely, stopping every few feet to strike a pose. He also wore sunglasses inside, which seemed a bit odd to Owen, given that the lights in the library weren&#x2019;t that bright.<br> <br>The man&#x2019;s sudden appearance sent Spike scrambling to hide elsewhere in the library, which wasn&#x2019;t unusual. The man watched him go with a strange look on his face. &#x201c;Cute cat,&#x201d; he said, turning back to Owen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can I help you?&#x201d; Owen asked him.<br> <br>&#x201c;There was no one at the counter, so I came back here,&#x201d; the man said, dropping the box at Owen&#x2019;s feet. He glanced around and made a disgusted face. &#x201c;Wow, you&#x2019;ve really let this place go, haven&#x2019;t you? Yikes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bethany gave Owen a confused look that told him she had no idea who the man was either. &#x201c;Did you want to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. donate these books?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I like about you, Bethany,&#x201d; the man said, grinning at her. &#x201c;You always cut to the chase. Yes, that&#x2019;s exactly what I want to do. It&#x2019;s all Kiel Gnomenfoot books, straight from Jonathan Porterhouse.&#x201d; The man took a book out of the box and handed it to Owen. &#x201c;The author said he was tired of having them around. Something about them being really badly written, and the main character is obnoxious and really terrible at magic and deserved to lose?&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen and Bethany shared another odd look. &#x201c;You can definitely donate the books,&#x201d; Owen said to the man, &#x201c;but we&#x2019;ll probably just end up adding them to our book sale. Not many people are checking these books out anymore.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, I have a feeling these copies will jump off the shelves&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. eventually,&#x201d; the man said, then winked in an exaggerated way. &#x201c;Just give them time. Now, I really should be going. Have another old friend to see, a long way from here. I&#x2019;ll tell her you both said hi. In the meantime, give that copy a close look, Owen. You&#x2019;ll definitely find it interesting reading!&#x201d; He waved and strode back toward the front of the library as Owen and Bethany just stared at each other.<br> <br>&#x201c;How did he know our names?&#x201d; Bethany asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;And who could be an old friend of his that we would know?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bethany glanced at the book Owen was holding. &#x201c;Are you going to look at that one, like he said to?&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen looked down at the cover, then brought it in close to his face, not sure what else to do. It was Kiel Gnomenfoot and the Infinite Reality, the fourth book, where Kiel and Charm tracked down one of the keys to the Source of Magic through parallel universes. He shrugged. &#x201c;It looks like any other book.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bethany took it out of his hands to drop it in the box. &#x201c;His voice sounded a little familiar, but I&#x2019;ve never seen his face. Maybe he&#x2019;s someone we met in a book or something?&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen shook his head. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s impossible. No one can travel between this world and the fictional one anymore.&#x201d;<br> <br>She sighed happily. &#x201c;I know, I&#x2019;m the least worried I&#x2019;ve been in my life. Without my fictional self, I don&#x2019;t break rules or jump into books. My mom knows everything about me, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She trailed off, looking away. &#x201c;I know I don&#x2019;t have Dad still, and that makes me sad. But you said he was okay when you last saw him, and I can&#x2019;t imagine anything happened to him after that, not since Nobody got his way. What would be the point of fighting anymore?&#x201d; She brightened up a bit. &#x201c;So really, everything worked out okay in the end, and now we&#x2019;re safe from my fictional self and her craziness. And there&#x2019;s no way that&#x2019;s going to change!&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen opened his mouth to agree, only to pause as the air between them began to spark, little electric fireworks exploding out of nowhere. Owen backed away in surprise, just as a person appeared out of thin air and crashed into Bethany. They both hit the floor hard, but the newcomer was the first one to stand, and Owen&#x2019;s eyes widened as he found himself staring at someone he never expected to see again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Owen!&#x201d; Kara Dox shouted, hugging him tightly. Instantly, a thousand questions filled his mind and a torrent of emotions flooded over him. &#x201c;I made it, finally! You wouldn&#x2019;t believe what I&#x2019;ve gone through to get here!&#x201d; She pulled away and took hold of his hand. &#x201c;You need to come with me right away. I&#x2019;ve seen your future, Owen. If we don&#x2019;t reconnect your world with the fictional one, you&#x2019;re going to die !&#x201d;</p><h2>Way Far Away on a Wild Safari</h2><p><b>Grab your binoculars<br> and follow me.<br> Let's travel far away<br> on a wild safari. <br> <br> There are lots of fun trails!<br> Many sights to see!<br> As we hike, hike, hike,<br> on this wild safari.</b></p><p><b>Jan Peck</b> has written stories and articles in <i>Highlights for Children, Boys' Life, Humpty Dumpty,</i> and <i>Turtle</i> magazines.

Before he became a novelist, Michael Connelly was a crime reporter, covering the detectives who worked the homicide beat in Florida and Los Angeles. In vivid, hard-hitting articles, Connelly leads the reader past the yellow police tape as he follows the investigators, the victims, their families and friends--and, of course, the killers--to tell the real stories of murder and its aftermath. Connelly's firsthand observations would lend inspiration to his novels, from <i>The Black Echo</i>, which was drawn from a real-life bank heist, to <i>Trunk Music</i>, based on an unsolved case of a man found in the trunk of his Rolls Royce.

Keane, for decades Ireland&#39;s favorite storyteller, this winning short story collection typifies the late author&#39;s folkloric imagination and storytelling arts. These are congenial tales, too, as this literary legend views the foibles and fallibilities of Irish country folk with abundant compassion as well as a shrewd, sometimes sardonic eye. Add to that Keane&#39;s glorious sense of fun and roguery that will make readers relish all the more how and why, in &#34;Fred Rimble,&#34; Jim Conlon kills the best friend he ever had. Or how Willie Ramley determines that his future wife will be &#34;Guaranteed Pure.&#34; Or how, to tragic as well as comic effect, a gasp, garlic, and gossip undo Denny Bruder in &#34;The Hanging.&#34; In all, Keane uncovers the folly in the romantic pangs, exalted aspirations, misguided mischief, and everyday shortcomings of the characters in the village of his storyteller&#39;s mind-and beyond the folly finds their humanity.</p><p>John B. Keane, the popular Irish playwright, poet, and publican, is the author of such novels as The Contractors and Durango and several volumes of short stories, among them An Irish Christmas Feast. Until his death in May 2002, he lived in Listowel, County Kerry, where he presided over one of the liveliest, most literary pubs in Ireland.&#34;Hilariously Irish, shrewdly accurate and richly creative.&#34;</p><h2>Hawkwind: Days of the Underground: Radical Escapism in the Age of Paranoia (Strange Attractor Press)</h2><p><p><b>An account of the English rock band Hawkwind shows them to be one of the most innovative and culturally significant bands of the 1970s.</b></p><p>Fifty years on from when it first formed, the English rock band Hawkwind continues to inspire devotion from fans around the world. Its influence reaches across the spectrum of alternative music, from psychedelia, prog, and punk, through industrial, electronica, and stoner rock. Hawkwind has been variously, if erroneously, positioned as the heir to both Pink Floyd and the Velvet Underground, and as Britain's answer to the Grateful Dead and Krautrock. It has defined a genre&#x2015;space rock&#x2015;while operating on a frequency that's uniquely its own.</p><p>Hawkwind offered a form of radical escapism and an alternative account of a strange new world for a generation of young people growing up on a planet that seemed to be teetering on the brink of destruction, under threat from economic meltdown, industrial unrest, and political polarization. While other commentators confidently asserted that the countercultural experiment of the 1960s was over, Hawkwind took the underground to the provinces and beyond. </p><p>In <i>Days of the Underground</i>, Joe Banks repositions Hawkwind as one of the most innovative and culturally significant bands of the 1970s. It's not an easy task. As with many bands of this era, a lazy narrative has built up around Hawkwind that doesn't do justice to the breadth of its ambition and achievements. Banks gives the lie to the popular perception of Hawkwind as one long lysergic soap opera; with <i>Days of the Underground</i>, he shows us just how revolutionary Hawkwind was.</p></p><p>Joe Banks is a music journalist who writes regularly for <i>MOJO</i>, <i>PROG</i>, <i>Shindig!</i>, <i>Rock &amp; Folk</i>, and <i>The Quietus</i>.</p><h2>Challenge of Command: Reading for Military Excellence (West Point Military History Series)</h2><p>&#x201c;A must for those who aspire to follow the profession of arms.&#x201d;&#x2014;Maj.

Blutrich, founder of Scores, the hottest strip club in New York history. A resourceful lawyer at one of the city&#x2019;s most respected firms, Blutrich fell into the skin trade almost by accident, but it was his legal savvy that made Scores the first club in Manhattan to feature lap dances and enabled him to neatly sidestep a law requiring dancers to wear pasties by instead covering their nipples with latex paint. Soon Scores, the club Howard Stern called like being in a candy shop,&#x201d; was a home away from home for everyone from sports superstars and Oscar-winning actors to pop singers and political notables alike.<br><br>The catch? The club was smack dab in John Gotti&#x2019;s territory, and the mafia wanted a piece of the action. The Gambino family doesn&#x2019;t take no for an answer . . . and neither, as it turns out, does the FBI. In his memoir, Blutrich recounts in detail how his beloved club became a hub for the mafia, and how he found himself caught up in an FBI investigation, sorely struggling to juggle roles of business owner and undercover spy.<br><br>As his life spiraled out of control, Blutrich would face the loss of almost everything dear to him. But whether marching a line of topless strippers as human exhibits into a trial to save the club&#x2019;s liquor license or wearing wires to meetings with armed gangsters, he never lost his sense of humor or his nerve. In <i>Scores</i>, Blutrich finally tells all from triumph to betrayal in his own funny, self-deprecating voice.</p><p>After distinguishing himself as an extraordinary undercover cooperator credited with almost 40 convictions of mafia defendants, <b>Michael Blutrich</b> was unexpectedly sentenced, over government opposition, to more than 13 years of imprisonment in the Federal Witness Security Program. Today he lives and works under a new identity in a secret location.<br><br>After graduating from the Georgetown University Law Center law, Blutrich had a distinguished legal career as a Park Avenue attorney, including a partnership with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. As an entrepreneur, he was the original owner of SCORES as well as several other popular nightclubs, owned an HBO boxing promotion enterprise, and for seven years hosted ?Psychic Eye,&#x201d; an acclaimed radio talk show on both WOR-AM and WEVD-AM in New York City. Anderson Cooper recently interviewed him on a segment of <i>60 Minutes</i> examining his undercover experiences.<br> A fascinating, funny, and, at times, frightening tale of strippers, money, and the mob by one of the FBI&#x2019;s most unlikely informants ever!&#x201d;<br><b> Anderson Cooper</b><br><br>"The Mob takes retribution seriously.

As Michael&#x2019;s lawyer, I was present for many of the events he describes, and, unbelievable as it may seem, his story is true. His case is like no other I&#x2019;ve encountered in my 40-year career, and his book will become an instant classic. Even knowing how it would end, I couldn&#x2019;t put the book down until the final page.&#x201d;<br><b> Morris Sandy&#x201d; Weinberg, Jr., Partner, Zuckerman Spaeder LLP, Tampa, FL, Former AUSA in the Southern District of New York, Chair-elect of the ABA Criminal Justice Section</b><br><br> Michael Blutrich, a smart lawyer from Brooklyn, was feeling pretty good when his new Upper East Side strip club became a must-visit destination for everyone from Leonardo Di Caprio to Donald Trump. Then Blutrich found out he had partners he hadn&#x2019;t known about: John Gotti&#x2019;s crime family. An irrepressible wiseacre, Blutrich&#x2019;s first thought was that he&#x2019;d seen nothing about that in the lease. Then a couple of hoods whacked two employees and things got very real, very fast. Soon, Blutrich became the least likely undercover agent the FBI ever had, wearing a wire against Gotham&#x2019;s biggest gangsters. But he kept his eyes open and his sense of humor and the result is this great read.&#x201d;<br><b> Tom Robbins, investigative reporter and coauthor of <i>Mob Boss</i></b></p><h2>The Folklore of the Freeway: Race and Revolt in the Modernist City (A Quadrant Book)</h2><p><p><br>When the interstate highway program connected America&#x2019;s cities, it also divided them, cutting through and destroying countless communities. Affluent and predominantly white residents fought back in a much heralded &#x201c;freeway revolt,&#x201d; saving such historic neighborhoods as Greenwich Village and New Orleans&#x2019;s French Quarter. This book tells of the <i>other</i> revolt, a movement of creative opposition, commemoration, and preservation staged on behalf of the mostly minority urban neighborhoods that lacked the political and economic power to resist the onslaught of highway construction.</p><p>Within the context of the larger historical forces of the 1960s and 1970s, Eric Avila maps the creative strategies devised by urban communities to document and protest the damage that highways wrought. The works of Chicanas and other women of color&#x2014;from the commemorative poetry of Patricia Preciado Martin and Lorna Dee Cervantes to the fiction of Helena Maria Viramontes to the underpass murals of Judy Baca&#x2014;expose highway construction as not only a racist but also a sexist enterprise. In colorful paintings, East Los Angeles artists such as David Botello, Carlos Almaraz, and Frank Romero satirize, criticize, and aestheticize the structure of the freeway. Local artists paint murals on the concrete piers of a highway interchange in San Diego&#x2019;s Chicano Park. The Rondo Days Festival in St. Paul, Minnesota, and the Black Archives, History, and Research Foundation in the Overtown neighborhood of Miami preserve and celebrate the memories of historic African American communities lost to the freeway.</p><p>Bringing such efforts to the fore in the story of the freeway revolt, <i>The Folklore of the Freeway </i>moves beyond a simplistic narrative of victimization. Losers, perhaps, in their fight against the freeway, the diverse communities at the center of the book nonetheless generate powerful cultural forces that shape our understanding of the urban landscape and influence the shifting priorities of contemporary urban policy.<br></p></p><p><p>Eric Avila is associate professor of history, Chicano studies, and urban planning at UCLA. He is the author of <i>Popular Culture in the Age of White Flight: Fear and Fantasy in Suburban Los Angeles.</i></p>&nbsp;"Eric Avila's in-depth research and his sheer passionate commitment to the subject should make this one of the rare books that succeeds in replacing a widely-accepted narrative." &#x2014;Robert Fishman, University of Michigan<br><br>"A must-read cultural history of the 'invisible freeway revolts' through which city people of color have demanded social justice in the midst of aggressive urban reforms. Avila provides timely lessons for scholars and urban planners, pointing us to pay closer attention to the aesthetic and expressive forms of these protests, so necssary to achieve spatial justice in American cities." &#x2014;Arlene Davila, New York University<br><br><p>"<i>The Folklore of the Freeway</i> fuses art and public policy in a graceful narrative."&#x2014;<i>KCET- LA Letters</i></p><p>"Each chapter is rich with details rarely considered, challenging readers to rethink their understanding of growth and development"&#x2014;<i>CHOICE</i></p><p>"Avila&#x2019;s book is critically important for placing communities of color at the center of the narrative of anti-highway activism. In showing us that culture is affected by political activities like highway construction, he makes a welcome intervention into a historical topic that has often ignored culture and suggests areas for further research."&#x2014;<i>American Studies Journal</i></p><p>"Avila&#x2019;s work is an important history of the modernist city and its discontents, transforming the narrative of the freeway revolt."&#x2014;<i>Journal of American History</i></p><p>"Eric Avila . . . has written a thoughtful account of the impact of the construction of the American Interstate highway system on the urban barrios and ghettos it often traversed."&#x2014;<i>Traditional Dwellings and Settlements Review</i></p><p>"<i>The Folklore of the Freeway </i>makes the invisible freeway revolt not only visible, but vivid, clear, and indisputable."&#x2014;<i>Buildings &amp; Settlements</i></p><p>"<i>The Folklore of the Freeway</i> offers a provocative account of the cultural history of the freeway in the American city, which interweaves past and present into a compelling narrative that challenges urban scholars to rethink the basic points of reference that have framed the storyline of the freeway revolt."&#x2014;<i>Urban Studies</i></p><p>"Avila&#x2019;s book serves not only as a reminder of the role that race and political power played in the placement of urban highways, but as call to remake the highway system more justly."&#x2014;<i>Planning Perspectives</i></p></p><h2>The Epistle of James: Proven Character Through Testing (The Grace New Testament Commentary Series)</h2><p>What is &#34;dead faith&#34;? What is &#34;justification by works&#34;? The Epistle of James has been one of the most misunderstood books in the New Testament. Many have been confused by thinking that it contradicts justification by faith alone, apart from works. Many have used James to teach a doctrine of salvation by works. Is that what James meant to say? With careful analysis of the text, Zane Hodges clears up the confusion surrounding this epistle and demonstrates conclusively that it is a message that needs to be taken to heart by Christians everywhere.</p><p>Zane Hodges has sought to live a life consistent with the marvelous and undeserved grace that his loving heavenly Father showed Zane, when He gave Zane the absolutely free gift of eternal life through faith alone in Jesus Christ.

The uprising contributed significantly to the collapse of a fascist regime in Lisbon and the dismantlement of Portugal&#x2019;s empire in Africa. Assassinated by a close associate with the deep complicity of the Portuguese colonial authorities, Cabral not only led one of Africa&#x2019;s most successful liberation movements, but was the voice and face of the anticolonial wars against Portugal.</p><p>A brilliant military strategist and astute diplomat, Cabral was an original thinker who wrote innovative and inspirational essays that still resonate today. His charismatic and visionary leadership, his active pan-Africanist solidarity and internationalist commitment to &#x201c;every just cause in the world,&#x201d; remain relevant to contemporary struggles for emancipation and self-determination.

Her first book published in the U.S., alphabet (New Directions, 2001), met with a tremendous response: &#34;Seductive,&#34; said Boston Review. &#34;A visionary reincarnation of the natural world in the atomic age,&#34; wrote The Chicago Review. Butterfly Valley: A Requiem collects four medium-length works, each startling for its beauty and formal innovation. &#34;Butterfly Valley&#34; is a sonnet cycle in which the glowing colors and beauty of butterflies are described, and yet also their obvious fragility and mortality: memory is uncovered in the poem like the fluttering of their wings. In &#34;Watersteps,&#34; the fountains and piazzas of Rome coalesce, brought alive by the imagination in the poem&#39;s shifting rhythms, lines, and overall structure. In &#34;Poem on Death&#34; the poet seeking immortality faces the whiteness of the page as the blankness of death: &#34;it feels so odd/ immodest to think/ about death when no one/ you know has died/ it means that each time/ you look at yourself in the mirror/ you look death in the eye/ without crying/ like a clear and fully/ comprehensible answer/ but to questions/ you dare not ask.&#34; &#34;Meeting&#34; describes a &#34;coming together,&#34; yet examines our failure to connect and the ability of language to overcome this. It is written in extended sections, with pathos, anger, and sly humor.</p><p><p><strong>Inger Christensen</strong> (1935&#x2013; 2009), whose work is a cornerstone of modern Scandinavian poetry, was the recipient of many international awards, among them the Nordic Authors&#x2019; Prize, bestowed by the Swedish Academy and known as the &#x201c;Little Nobel.&#x201d; Her books include the masterpiece <em>it</em>; <em>alphabet</em>; <em>Butterfly Valley;</em> and <em>Light, Grass, and Letter in April.</em></p><p><strong>Susanna Nied</strong>'s work has appeared in various literary journals and anthologies.

The introduction suggests they are fun for new knitters; I note that you would need to be happy with increases, decreases and sewing up before tackling them. I have a box where short short odd ends of handspun yarn are collected and here is a book full of suitable patterns. Most toys are around five to eight centimetres in finished size, the tallest due to his ears, is a 9cm tall chubby bunny. All of the patterns in the book were knitted on double-pointed 2.75mm needles and require some sewing up and a small quanitity of stuffing. I tried out the Chubby Bunny pattern, it took a couple of short sessions to knit the pieces and another to assemble the parts. My bunny came out like the picture, a comic book type figure with a large head. * Yarnmaker *</p><h2>The Anatomy of Humbug: How to Think Differently about Advertising</h2><p>How does advertising work? Does it have to attract conscious attention in order to transmit a &#39;Unique Selling Proposition&#39;? Or does it insinuate emotional associations into the subconscious mind? Or is it just about being famous... or maybe something else? In Paul Feldwick&#39;s radical new view, all theories of how advertising works have their uses - and all are dangerous if they are taken too literally as the truth. The Anatomy of Humbug deftly and entertainingly picks apart the historical roots of our common - and often contradictory - beliefs about advertising, in order to create space for a more flexible, creative and effective approach to this fascinating and complex field of human communication. Drawing on insights ranging from the nineteenth-century showman P.T. Barnum to the twentieth-century communications theorist Paul Watzlawick, as well as influential admen such as Bernbach, Reeves and Ogilvy, Feldwick argues that the advertising industry will only be able to deal with increasingly rapid change in the media landscape if it both understands its past and is able to criticise its most entrenched habits of thought. The Anatomy of Humbug is an accessible business book that will help advertising and marketing professionals create better campaigns.</p><p>Paul Feldwick worked in an advertising agency for over thirty years. Since leaving he has worked as a consultant in the fields of strategy, brands, and organisational change, but retains a strong fascination for advertising itself. He has Master&#39;s degrees from the University of Bath School of Management and Ashridge Business School.&#34;A unique and extraordinary book&#34; -- Rory Sutherland * Ogilvy London * &#39;Buy this book.

Milton, an artist, thinks he has been invited to do some paintings for Nevinson, a rich businessman. But when the Nevinsons mention a flute player that no one else can hear, Woodsley begins to glean that there is more to their stay. Told in Woodsley&#x2019;s skeptical, self-mocking and good-humored voice, Mittelholzer creates a brilliantly atmospheric setting for his characters and their terrified discovery that this is not a place where they can be at home.</p><p><b>Edgar Mittelholzer</b> was born in New Amsterdam in what was still British Guiana.

Wafting from the kitchen, the smell of chicken smothered in cream and pepper until it&#x2019;s falling off the bone. I&#x2019;m playing an ancient wind-up record left over from when my father was a boy; &#x201c;K-K-K-Katy&#x201d; crackles in my ear. Through my grandmother&#x2019;s open bedroom door, I glimpse chintz dust ruffles, hatboxes, the slender oval mirror over the dressing table, where she leans, and I see her dab the fluffy puff between her legs.<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#x2019;s it: brief cloud of bath powder, grinding consonant K-K-K-Katy (<i>I&#x2019; ll be waiting at the k-k-k-kitchen</i> <i>door</i>), warped light throwing rainbows back through the door. And I wonder, always, why do such fragments remain forever engraved, when, surely, significant ones are lost? The kitchen fragrance, no mystery. For who, ever, could forget Fanny&#x2019;s smothered chicken?<br>&nbsp;<br>An early memory of my father: He opens his buff hunting coat, and in all the small interior pockets, doves&#x2019; heads droop. He and his friends Bascom and Royce break out the bourbon. From my room in the back of the house, right off the kitchen, I see through the keyhole (keyholes are a large part of childhood) the doves he&#x2019;s killed piled on the counter, and someone&#x2019;s hand cleaning a shotgun barrel with a dishrag. The terrible plop-ploop sound of feathers being plucked makes me bury my face under the pillow. When his friends go, my father stays at the table with his tumbler of bourbon. I&#x2019;m reading with a flashlight under the covers. My specialty is orphans on islands where houses have trapdoors into secret passageways that lead to the sea. Rowboats, menace, treasure, and no parents in the story. As the water darkens and danger grows, I hear my father talking to himself. When I quietly crack the door, I see his head in his hands, his bloodstained coat hung on a hook. Very late, he hits the wall with his fist, and says over and over, &#x201c;Beastly, Christly, beastly, Christly.&#x201d; I put the palm of my hand over the spot where he is pounding with his fist and feel the vibration all the way up my arm. I press my nose to the window screen and look out at the still backyard.<br>&nbsp;<br>A tea olive tree grows outside my bedroom window, its scent airy, spicy, and I prefer it to the dizzy perfume of the gardenias and magnolias that rule the neighborhood. Tough ovoid leaves scrape the screen; the tiny flower clusters are fit only for dollhouse bouquets. Then the back door slams and the car screeches out the driveway.<br>&nbsp;<br>My father&#x2019;s parents live two blocks away. I like to gaze into the silver globe under the giant oak in their backyard. My face looks distorted and moony, especially when I cross my eyes and stick out my tongue. In the mirrored sphere, the yard curves back, foregrounded with oak branches like enormous claws. On the latticed back porch, my grandmother Mayes washes a bowl of peaches with her maid, Fanny Brown. Mother Mayes&#x2019;s hair is as silvery as the garden globe, and her crepey skin so white she&#x2019;s almost blue. She looks as though she might dissolve or disappear&#x2014;her pale eyes always seem fixed on somewhere just beyond me.<br>&nbsp;<br>Late in the afternoon, she puts up her bare feet on an ottoman. With the lamp haloing her hair, she&#x2019;s ethereal, but then I see crude, tough yellow corns on the last two toes of each foot. They&#x2019;re translucent in the lamp&#x2019;s glow, as she relaxes with <i>The</i> <i>Upper Room, </i>a church book of devotional reading, open on her lap.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dove heads, tea olive, silver globe, bowl of peaches, church books. Images are the pegs holding down memory&#x2019;s billowing tent. From them, I try to figure out who my people were and where we lived, what they did and what they could have done.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>South Georgia, where I was born, may look to a stranger speeding down I-75 like lonesome country where you can drive for miles without seeing more than a canebrake rattlesnake cross the road. At the city limits of our town a sign said if you lived here you&#x2019;d be home now. The logic is irrefutable. Thin roads shimmering in the heat lead into Fitzgerald from Ocilla, Mystic, Lulaville, Osierfield, Pinetta, Waterloo, Land&#x2019;s Crossing, Bowen&#x2019;s Mill, and Irwinville, where Jefferson Davis was captured by the Yankees. Then, no I-75 existed.<br>&nbsp;<br>To those whose ribs were formed from red clay, the place is complex, exhilarating, charged, various: mighty brown rivers to float along, horizons drawn with an indigo pen, impossibly tall longleaf pines, virulent racism (then, and not all erased now), the heat that makes your heart beat thickly against your chest, the self-satisfaction of those of us who have always lived there, tornadoes twirling in a purple sky, the word &#x201c;repent&#x201d; nailed to trees. A place of continuous contradiction, a box with a false bottom. A black rag doll becomes a white doll when I turn her upside down. I jump onto soft green moss behind the cotton mill and sink into sewage. Daddy in his white suit fishes me out, shouting curses. I&#x2019;m born knowing that the place itself runs through me like rain soaking into sand.<br>We are fabric people, as others are the Miwok people, circus people, lost people. In the cotton mill&#x2014;my father&#x2019;s business&#x2014;the light is gray because lint catches in the screened windows. Oily black machines, gigantic strung looms as beautiful as harps, their shuttles pulled by lean women. Bins to climb and then dive from into piled raw cotton. In the tin cup of the scale over the bin I ride, the needle jerking between fifty and fifty-five pounds, then fly out, the landing not as gentle as I expect. Rayon is softer, and squeaks as I fall in. But to fly, actually, as in dreams. A natural act, as later I would swing out over the spring on vines at night, dropping into cold black water below, crawl up the slippery bank, grabbing roots, then swing out again and again for that moment of falling. Water moccasins, thick as my leg, thirty-pound rockfish with primitive snouts, even crocodiles lived in these deep streams I dove into, pushing my fist into the icy &#x201c;boils,&#x201d; that bubbling force at the bottom.<br>&nbsp;<br>While my father ran the cotton mill and hunted birds, my mother gathered, and created perfect bridge luncheons, with the aid of our cook Willie Bell. The house pulsated with cleanliness. My two sisters were both in college by the time I was eight, but I stayed in my room at the back of the house instead of moving into theirs. Often I riffled through their scrapbooks and high school notebooks in their closet, and tried on their left-behind dresses that had more flounces than mine, and the flowery scent of White Shoulders lingering in the tucks and pleats.<br>&nbsp;<br>I loved the square brick Carnegie library, the quiet that engulfs you as you gently close the door, the globe to spin and stop, with a finger on Brazil or China, the cold light in the high windows in winter, the way the bookcases jut out to make little rooms, my yellow card with due-date stamps, the brass return slot, the desk where presides the librarian, who looks like a large squirrel. Before<br>kindergarten, my sisters showed me the low bookcase<br>for my<br>age. I moved year by year to a different section of the back room.<br>So much later, I may cross the threshold into the main library<br>where I can check out only two, then four books.<br>&nbsp;<br>Other literature was mail order. I never had seen a real book-<br>store. We had Book of the Month. We subscribed to <i>Harper&#x2019;s</i><br><i>Bazaar, </i>for copying dresses, <i>Reader&#x2019;s Digest, </i>required for school,<br>and, for some reason, <i>Arizona Highways</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Fitzgerald, where I might have lived forever, was as rigidly hierarchical as England. We had our aristocracy, with dukes, bar sinisters, jokers, local duchesses in black Cadillacs, many earls, and, of course, ladies, ladies, ladies, many of them always in waiting. Everything and everyone had a place and everything and everyone was in it. It was a cloying, marvelous, mysterious, and obnoxious world, as I later came to know, but fate placed me there and, although the house was not lilting, I was <i>happy as</i> <i>the grass was green.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>We were not normal. We lived next door to normal people, so I knew what normal was. The father worked for the state agriculture department, the mother gave a perm called a &#x201c;Toni&#x201d; to her sisters and friends, and they laughed and had fun as they breathed in ammonia fumes. Their boy sang in the choir, and the daughter, Jeannie, with wild hair, was my playmate.<br>We found house-paint cans in the barn and brushed black and white enamel over each other. Our irate mothers scoured us with kerosene, and Jeannie seemed to be lifted in the jaws of her mother like a kitten and taken home. Her father built a swing set with a pair of rings that we learned to grip, push off into a somersault, vault up on our feet, and hang upside down. On the swings we could pump so high we&#x2019;d almost flip over the top. He took us to farms in his truck and we sat in back eating raw peanuts we&#x2019;d pulled from the ground. They tasted like dirt. Jeannie and I made hideouts in the vacant lot next to her house, elaborate setups of pallets and cardboard boxes, with tin doll dishes and stolen kitchen knives. We sat on a pile of sour grass weed poring over the Sears, Roebuck catalog. <i>What would</i> <i>you choose if you could choose anything on this page? </i>After pelting rains, our walls sagged. On Christmas mornings, she and I ran back and forth between our houses, looking at what Santa left, long before anyone awoke. We strung tin cans with string between our bedrooms, but never could hear a thing. Her mother, Matrel, had lively sisters named Pearl, Ruby, and Jewel. Her uncle always called us &#x201c;Coosaster Jane,&#x201d; which we thought was German he&#x2019;d learned in the war. She called her daddy &#x201c;Pappy.&#x201d; He was strong, redheaded, and sweet. I wonder why I did not envy them. I think small children may have no imagination for a life that is not their own lot.<br>&nbsp;<br>Other families were happy, too. &#x201c;The Greeks&#x201d; were happy even though their daughter Calliope had polio and had to walk with crutches and go to Warm Springs and lie in an iron lung, that awful water heater turned on its side. The Lanes were happy even though the father drove a potato chip truck for endless hours and the delicate mother had a problem so that their bathroom was stacked to the ceiling with sanitary napkin boxes. I was in awe over how they pampered Rose Ann. My best friend, Edna Lula, was the only child in the perfect family. She was doted on and prettily plump; their house had beds with warm dips in the middle like nests, and French doors that opened onto a long porch with a swing. Happy mother and daddy who called her by a nickname left over from baby talk. I could not be at her house enough. There, I fell under their bountiful love. They thought I was funny. They called me by my family nickname, Bud. There was no chink. Ribbon candy always filled the same dish on the sideboard. We licked peach ice cream off the wooden beater, loved pouring the rock salt slush out of the churn. They were admiring, told jokes, hugged; their garden fish pool had a statue of a naked boy, clean water coming out of his thing, landing on the old goldfish in the murk. There was a baby grand piano. My friend plunked out &#x201c;Song of the Volga Boatman,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Blest Be the Tie That Binds.&#x201d; Church not only Sunday morning but the evening service, too. (I drew the line at that.)<br>&nbsp;<br>My mother and her friends laid swatches of fabric over sofas. They carried samples of peach, ivory, teal, and cream paint in their purses. They contemplated the recovered wing chair with the attention surgeons give to incisions. Pale peach is a good color, a lasting color; it never looks as if the chair has just been done. You never want the chair to appear just done. There are fine points: double welting, never tacks except on leather. The act of attention was intense and disciplined. The house must have a sense of itself. Greens and blues will fool you; you don&#x2019;t remember shades as well as you think.<br>&nbsp;<br>My mother wants color and polish and devotion. She wants the linens ironed and the windows clean. Fabric, stitching, tatting, piecing into designs, interfacing for durability and form. Her friend Grace can see a dress on someone in Atlanta, go home, and cut the pattern out of newspaper. The methods are sound: hem by picking up the stitch, doubling back for it then going forward, around a circle, as in writing&#x2014;the piercing bright words, the tension of the thread.<br>&nbsp;<br>The network of women existed in a world as private as purdah. Among themselves, my mother&#x2019;s friends were brutally frank, raucous, and never oblivious to compromise. Talk was of <i>should, </i>of standards, local gossip, and, at least five times a day, of how each person looked. Judging every nuance of appearance was part of our chromosomal makeup. They went out as if disguised by veils. Appearance. And feigned innocence, the vise that keeps women &#x201c;girls&#x201d; well into their sixties.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A generality may have a use, as does a bludgeon, but it obliterates what is of particular use by oversimplifying. Nothing has been dealt this blow so much as the southern woman, black and white. The power behind the throne, iron hand in velvet glove, she endured (what else could she do?), belle of three counties, a little vixen, <i>she&#x2019;s like a member of the family, </i>a great lady, ad infinitum, ad nauseam, and all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding.<br>&nbsp;<br>Every mother I knew could cook like the devil. There&#x2019;s their <i>jouissance, </i>that fine, forgotten-in-English word. Pressed chicken, brown sugar muffins, quail (smothered), Sally Lunn bread, grits with cheese, a spectrum of pies with lemon meringue as the lowest, and black bottom as the epitome. Lane Cake (which no Northerner could ever hope to emulate in this life or the next), and key lime when Mr. Bernhardt got in the Key West limes at his fruit stand. No matter what. Unconditionally, we will cook, from restorative broths to nutmeg custards to grand heroic meals.<br>&nbsp;<br>The splendid matriarchs with power in the open were rare birds. And always endangered. More common is the third-rate power, manipulation. We learned it as we learned cartwheels and the multiplication table. I had my daddy wrapped around my little finger when I was five because I was &#x201c;a pistol,&#x201d; his &#x201c;sweetheart and buddy.&#x201d; We knew Scarlett could get Rhett back. &#x201c;Blink your eyes slowly as you look up at a boy,&#x201d; my mother instructs. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t swim so much.

There&#x2019;s a fury within him, and he fears he has become dangerous to those he loves. He arrives in New York at a time of unprecedented plenty, in the highest hour of America&#x2019;s wealth and power, seeking to &#x201c;erase&#x201d; himself. But fury is all around him.

Salman Rushdie hauls his hero, Malik Solanka, from Bombay to London to New York, and finally to a fictional Third World country, all in order to show off a preternatural ability to riff on anything from Bollywood musicals to revolutionary politics. Professor Solanka is propelled on this path by his strange love of dolls. He plays with them as a child; as an adult he quits his post at Cambridge in order to produce a TV show wherein an animated doll, Little Brain, meets the great thinkers of history. Little Brain becomes a smash hit, and perhaps inevitably, Solanka finds himself in America. (It's not only the show-biz version of manifest destiny that brings him to the New World: one night in London he finds himself standing over the sleeping figures of his beloved wife and child, frighteningly close to stabbing them. This intellectual puppeteer is, of course, fleeing himself.)<p> Now, in New York, he is filled with wrath. Solanka is far from being an Everyman, but his fury is a kind of Everyfury. It's road rage writ large--the natural reaction to an excess of mental traffic. There are several books running simultaneously here: a mystery, a family romance, a bitingly satirical portrait of millennial Manhattan, and a sci-fi revolutionary fantasy. A single fragment gives a sense of Rushdie's reflexive multiplicity: when Solanka finally faces his memories of childhood, he recalls "his damn Yoknapatawpha, his accursed Malgudi." Here's a writer who, leading us into the tender places of his protagonist's soul, stops long enough to reference not just Faulkner but Narayan as well. If it sounds like a bit of a mess, it is. If it sounds frighteningly intelligent, it's that too. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>"Salman Rushdie&#x2019;s great grasp of the human tragicomedy--its dimensions, its absurdities and horrors--has made him one of the most intelligent fiction writers in the English language."<br>--Gail Caldwell, <i>The Boston Globe</i><br><br>"<b>Fury</b> is a profoundly, ecstatically affirmative work of fiction.

During the Cold War, CIA and Air Force officials chose this remote location to shield such efforts from foreign spies and US citizens. Although the base has been known by many names&#x2015;Paradise Ranch, Watertown, and Dreamland, among others&#x2015;the designation &#x201c;Area 51&#x201d; has taken root most deeply in the public imagination. Since 1955, it has grown from a temporary camp into a national test facility supporting nearly 2,000 military and civilian workers and dozens of projects, including aircraft capable of cruising at Mach 3 and stealth airplanes that are virtually invisible to radar. Although secrecy surrounding Area 51 spawned rumors of UFOs and reverse-engineered alien spacecraft, declassified photographs provide a rare glimpse into the true nature of America&#x2019;s most famous secret base.</p><p>Peter W. Merlin has authored numerous books and articles on aerospace history and technology.

As the author of this inspirational true story, Albom uses verbal inflection in exactly the right places to evoke humor, empathy, and emotion. It's an honest reading, and the underlying timbre of private memory pushes it past mere recitation to pure storytelling.<p> The titular Morrie was Morrie Schwartz, Albom's university professor 20 years before the events being narrated. An accidental viewing of an interview with Morrie on <i>Nightline</i> led Albom to become reunited with his old teacher, friend, and "coach" at a time when Albom, a successful sportswriter, was struggling to define dissatisfactions with his own life and career. Morrie, on the other hand, after a rich life filled with friends, family, teaching, and music, was dying from Lou Gehrig's disease, a crippling illness that diminished his activities daily. Albom was one of hundreds of former students and acquaintances who traveled great distances to visit Morrie in the final months of his life.</p><p> The 14 Tuesday visits that followed their reunion took Albom--and will take listeners with him--on a journey of reawakening to life's best rewards. The story is told in a journalistic style that never crosses into pathos. That a professional writer can write well is not surprising, but Albom also reads well, with clear enunciation and a talent for mimicry. Another reader might have interpreted the professor's aphorisms as droll humor or wrung a wrong note at an inappropriate moment, making the story a maudlin tearjerker; instead it is read for what it is, a tribute to a remarkable teacher.

It parallels the story of Jean B., a filmmaker who abandons his wife and career to hole up in a Paris hotel, with that of Ingrid and Rigaud, a refugee couple he&#39;d met twenty years before, and whose mystery continues to haunt him.</p><p>Jean B., the narrator of Patrick Modiano&#39;s Honeymoon, is submerged in a world where day and night, past and present, have no demarcations. Having spent his adult life making documentary films about lost explorers, Jean suddenly decides to abandon his wife and career, and takes what seems to be a journey to nowhere. He pretends to fly to Rio to make another film, but instead returns to his own Parisian suburb to spend his solitary days recounting or imagining the lives of Ingrid and Rigaud, a refugee couple he had met twenty years before, and in whom he had recognized a spiritual anomie that seemed to reflect and justify his own. Little by little, their story takes on more reality than Jean&#39;s daily existence, as his excavation of the past slowly becomes an all-encompassing obsession.Winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature, Patrick Modiano was born in Paris in 1945.

But sometimes the solutions are not as interesting as the beautiful symmetric patterns that lead to them. Written in a friendly style for a general audience, <i>Fearless Symmetry</i> is the first popular math book to discuss these elegant and mysterious patterns and the ingenious techniques mathematicians use to uncover them.</p><br><p> Hidden symmetries were first discovered nearly two hundred years ago by French mathematician �variste Galois. They have been used extensively in the oldest and largest branch of mathematics--number theory--for such diverse applications as acoustics, radar, and codes and ciphers. They have also been employed in the study of Fibonacci numbers and to attack well-known problems such as Fermat's Last Theorem, Pythagorean Triples, and the ever-elusive Riemann Hypothesis. Mathematicians are still devising techniques for teasing out these mysterious patterns, and their uses are limited only by the imagination.</p><br><p> The first popular book to address representation theory and reciprocity laws, <i>Fearless Symmetry</i> focuses on how mathematicians solve equations and prove theorems. It discusses rules of math and why they are just as important as those in any games one might play. The book starts with basic properties of integers and permutations and reaches current research in number theory. Along the way, it takes delightful historical and philosophical digressions. Required reading for all math buffs, the book will appeal to anyone curious about popular mathematics and its myriad contributions to everyday life.</p></p><p><p>"All too often, abstract mathematics, one of the most beautiful of human intellectual creations, is ground into the dry dust of drills and proofs. Useful, yes; exciting, no. Avner Ash and Robert Gross have done something different--by focusing on the ideas that modern mathematicians actually care about. <i>Fearless Symmetry</i> is a book about detecting hidden patterns, about finding definitions that clarify, about the study of numbers that has entranced some of our great thinkers for thousands of years. It is a book that takes on number theory in a way that a nonmathematician can follow-systematically but without a barrage of technicalities. Ash and Gross are two terrific guides who take the reader, scientist or layman, on a wonderful hike through concepts that matter, culminating in the extraordinary peaks that surround the irresistible, beckoning claim of Fermat's Last Theorem."<b>--Peter Galison, Harvard University</b></p><b>Avner Ash</b> is professor of mathematics at Boston College and the coauthor of <i>Smooth Compactification of Locally Symmetric Varieties</i>. <b>Robert Gross</b> is associate professor of mathematics at Boston College.</p><h2>Infinitesimal Calculus (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p>Rigorous undergraduate treatment introduces calculus at the basic level, using infinitesimals and concentrating on theory rather than applications.

Read it to understand our country.&nbsp;Spanish is, indeed, an American language."&#x2014;Jorge Ramos</b><br><br><i>An American Language </i>is a tour de force that revolutionizes our understanding of U.S. history. It reveals the origins of Spanish as a language binding residents of the Southwest to the politics and culture of an expanding nation in the 1840s. As the West increasingly integrated into the United States over the following century, struggles over power, identity, and citizenship transformed the place of the Spanish language in the nation. <i>An American Language </i>is a history that reimagines what it means to be an American&#x2014;with profound implications for our own time.</p><p>&#x201c;Original and provocative, beautifully written and argued,&nbsp;<i>An American Language</i> tells a story of our nation&#x2019;s past that brilliantly illuminates our present: that the United States of America was born multilingual.&#x201d;&#x2014;John Mack Faragher, Howard R.

How can good and compassionate people hurt and kill others or themselves? Why are people much more likely to kill or assault people they know well, rather than strangers? This provocative and radical book shows that people mostly commit violence because they genuinely feel that it is the morally right thing to do. In perpetrators&#39; minds, violence may be the morally necessary and proper way to regulate social relationships according to cultural precepts, precedents, and prototypes. These moral motivations apply equally to the violence of the heroes of the Iliad, to parents smacking their child, and to many modern murders and everyday acts of violence. Virtuous Violence presents a wide-ranging exploration of violence across different cultures and historical eras, demonstrating how people feel obligated to violently create, sustain, end, and honor social relationships in order to make them right, according to morally motivated cultural ideals.</p><p>Why do people hurt and kill others, or themselves? This provocative book argues that people mostly commit violence because they feel that it is the morally right thing to do. Virtuous Violence shows how human nature, culture, and social relationships can generate violence - or nonviolence.Alan Page Fiske is Professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he has also served as Director of the Behavior Evolution and Culture Center, and Director of the Culture, Brain, and Development Center.

The text presents a much-needed, in-depth assessment of child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, abuse by clergy, abuse of the elderly and disabled, and abuse in sports. Among the specific problems covered are bullying and sibling abuse, courtship violence and date rape, and abuse in the relationships of sexual minorities. The author explores these complex issues using an ecological approach, examining interacting explanations from a variety of perspectives and levels of analysis: societal and cultural, family, and individual.<p> The author's down-to-earth, conversational style is easy to understand, and his work is exceptionally well researched and thoroughly documented. Those who are pursuing careers in the fields of sociology, psychology, psychiatry, and human-service professions such as social work, pastoral counseling, mental health counseling, marriage and family therapy, and psychiatric nursing will find this text valuable.</p><p> End-of-chapter resources include a Review Guide, Critical Thinking Questions, Recommended Reading, Internet Resources, and Suggested Activities.</p></p><p>"Great comprehensive text.

Highly recommended." --Jay Vargas, Minnesota West Community &amp; Technical College</p><h2>An Introduction to Medieval Theology (Introduction to Religion)</h2><p>Medieval theology, in all its diversity, was radically theo-centric, Trinitarian, Scriptural and sacramental. It also operated with a profound view of human understanding (in terms of intellectus rather than mere ratio). In a post-modern climate, in which the modern views on &#39;autonomous reason&#39; are increasingly being questioned, it may prove fruitful to re-engage with pre-modern thinkers who, obviously, did not share our modern and post-modern presuppositions. Their different perspective does not antiquate their thought, as some of the &#39;cultured despisers&#39; of medieval thought might imagine. On the contrary, rather than rendering their views obsolete it makes them profoundly challenging and enriching for theology today. This book is more than a survey of key medieval thinkers (from Augustine to the late-medieval period); it is an invitation to think along with major theologians and explore how their thought can deeply challenge some of today&#39;s modern and post-modern key assumptions.</p><p>This book is essential reading for all those who are interested in medieval thought, be they students of theology, philosophy or literature of the medieval period. Rik van Nieuwenhove discusses a radically theo-centric perspective and shows how medieval thought both challenges and enriches theology today.Rik Van Nieuwenhove is Lecturer in Theology in Limerick, Ireland.

Earlier accounts depict both as barbarians, lacking in culture and in need of civilization. By the nineteenth century, intermarriage and cultural contact between the two--described during the Seven Years' War as cousins--was such that Cree, Mohawk, Cherokee, and Salish were often spoken with Gaelic accents.<br><br> In this imaginative work of imperial and tribal history, Colin Calloway examines why these two seemingly wildly disparate groups appear to have so much in common.<br><br> Both Highland clans and Native American societies underwent parallel experiences on the peripheries of Britain's empire, and often encountered one another on the frontier. Indeed, Highlanders and American Indians fought, traded, and lived together. Both groups were treated as tribal peoples--remnants of a barbaric past--and eventually forced from their ancestral lands as their traditional food sources--cattle in the Highlands and bison on the Great Plains--were decimated to make way for livestock farming. In a familiar pattern, the cultures that conquered them would later romanticize the very ways of life they had destroyed.<br><br> <em>White People, Indians, and Highlanders</em> illustrates how these groups alternately resisted and accommodated the cultural and economic assault of colonialism, before their eventual dispossession during the Highland Clearances and Indian Removals. What emerges is a finely-drawn portrait of how indigenous peoples with their own rich identities experienced cultural change, economic transformation, and demographic dislocation amidst the growing power of the British and American empires.<br></p><p><br><strong>Colin G.

Reid, <em>The</em> <em>Journal of American History</em><p></p><br>"Calloway's study offers a compelling historical portrait of two groups struggling to maintain their homeland and cultural identities amid the turmoil and confusion unleashed by Euroamerican imperialism."--Kevin T. Barksdale, <em>Virginia Magazine of History &amp; Biography</em><p></p><br>"<em>White People, Indians, and Highlanders</em> deserves a readership a readership interested in colonialism and ethnic identities on both sides of the Atlantic. With brilliant insights from the literatures and experiences of both Scottish and Native American studies, Calloway demonstrates the value of placing Native American and Scottish history in a much wider context than they normally appear."--Andrew K. Frank, <em>Southwest Journal of Culture</em><p></p><br>"<em>White People, Highlanders, and Indians</em> is a welcome addition to studies of the colonial experience. Equally at home in the Highlands and in Indian Country, in the imperial capitals of London and Washington, D.C., Colin Calloway brings to light a fascinating, colorful world that sets side by side Gaelic and Iroquois, breech cloths and kilts, 'Removals' and 'Clearances,' even today's Highland festivals and Indian powwows. Among the book's virtues is its awareness that, while Highlanders and Indians are comparable in illuminating and important ways, their histories were also profoundly different--in illuminating and important ways."--James H. Merrell, Vassar College<p></p><br>"A fascinating study that successfully compares in an insightful and original way the experience of both Highland Scots and American Indians; accessible and perceptive, it makes a significant contribution to Atlantic and imperial history, as well to the remarkable story of these two peoples."--Tom Devine, University of Edinburgh<p></p><br>"In this fine study Colin Calloway has punctured many of the stereotypes that have often followed Scottish Highlanders and American Indians like persistent shadows. Calloway has thrust these peoples to the forefront of history by evoking the commonalities of their past and drawing their lives together through a pageant of stories that recall the tales of early storytellers, both Highlander and Indian, who once held forth on long winter nights."--Margaret Connell Szasz, author of <em>Scottish Highlanders and Native Americans: Indigenous Education in the Eighteenth-Century Atlantic World</em><p></p><br>"Calloway reminds us how much the past remains within the present; hence the identities claimed by Scots, Indians, and Indian Scots today have been forged by their colonial experiences, their uprooting, and their many encounters with each other from the seventeenth century forward."--Margaret Connell Szaz, <em>Journal of British Studies</em><p></p><br>"By situating the story of Indians and Highlanders in teh larger Atlantic world of empire building, Calloway makes a tought-provoking case for his argument of similitude...A fine example of comparative and Atlantic world history."--<em>Montana: The Magazine of Southern History</em><p></p><br>"An interesting and illuminating read."--<em>Virginia Quarterly Review</em><p></p><br>"No specialist in early Indian history can approach Calloway's combination of diversity of subject matter, scholarly output, and quality...Calloway's discussion of the parallel and divergent colonial experiences of Indians and Scottish Highlanders and his treatment of the two peoples' many encounters in North America will be appreciated by anyone interested in empires and native peoples."--Joshua Piker, <em>Journal of Social History</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Future 1 Workbook with Audio CD</h2><p><p>The <i> <b> <i>Future&nbsp;</i> </b> </i> <b>Workbook with Audio CD</b> allows students to devote their time to the lessons and specific skill areas that they need to work on most.

A Nation of Rights explores the implications of this major change by bringing legal history into dialogue with the scholarship of other historical fields. Federal policy on slavery and race, particularly the three Reconstruction amendments, are the best-known legal innovations of the era. Change, however, permeated all levels of the legal system, altering Americans&#39; relationship to the law and allowing them to move popular conceptions of justice into the ambit of government policy. The results linked Americans to the nation through individual rights, which were extended to more people and, as a result of new claims, were reimagined to cover a wider array of issues. But rights had limits in what they could accomplish, particularly when it came to the collective goals that so many ordinary Americans advocated. Ultimately, Laura F. Edwards argues that this new nation of rights offered up promises that would prove difficult to sustain.</p><p>Although hundreds of thousands of people died fighting in the Civil War, perhaps the war&#39;s biggest casualty was the nation&#39;s legal order.

It showcases the Art Therapy Relational Neuroscience (ATR-N) theoretical and clinical approach, and demonstrates how it can be used to help clients with autobiographical memory, reflecting and creating, touch and space, meaning-making, emotions, and dealing with long-term stress and trauma.<br><br> The ATR-N approach, first developed by Noah Hass-Cohen, is comprised of six principles: Creative Embodiment, Relational Resonating, Expressive Communicating,&nbsp;Adaptive Responding, Transformative Integrating, and Empathizing and Compassion (CREATE). The chapters in this book are organized around these CREATE principles, demonstrating the dynamic interplay of brain and bodily systems during art therapy.<br><br> Each chapter begins with an overview of one CREATE principle, which is then richly illustrated with therapeutic artwork and intrapersonal reflections. The subsequent discussion of the related relational neuroscience elucidates how the ATR-N work is grounded in research and evidence-based theory. The last section of each chapter, which is devoted to clinical skills and applications, integrates practices and approaches across all six of the CREATE principles, demonstrating how therapeutic art making can help people decipher the functional mystery of their relational nervous system, enhance their emotive and cognitive abilities, and increase the motivation to learn novel concepts and participate in a meaningful social discourse.</p><p><p><strong>Noah Hass-Cohen, PsyD,</strong> has developed a theoretical model for art psychotherapy.

[T]his book provides a language for art therapists to use in communicating our innovative and effective ways of understanding the brain as a biopsychosocial and spiritual organ. . . . Art therapists very much need the information compiled by Hass-Cohen and Findlay to help us understand what it is that we do with science, how it is that we do it, and why it works.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Art Therapy</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[A]s helpful for learning about the brain and its various functions as it is for learning about art therapy. . . . [F]or those studying or practicing art therapy, or for a well-informed reader with a particular interest, it is difficult to imagine a more comprehensive text.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>PsychCentral</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Having been doing art therapy for more than 50 years, I believed that I was familiar with&nbsp;the majority of theories informing our work. However, until I read this book, I did not fully&nbsp;appreciate the significance of neuroscience to our discipline. This thoughtful and carefully&nbsp;organized volume masterfully presents the vast literature from which it draws, and is teeming with information on interpersonal domains and art therapy. Most helpful is that the authors have also developed very creative clinical and pedagogical approaches to implementing and explicating their art therapy relational neuroscience approach.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Judith A. Rubin, Ph.D., ATR-BC, editor of <i>Approaches to Art Therapy: Theory and Technique</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;What a fascinating book! The authors apply a sophisticated knowledge of interpersonal neurobiology to the practice of art therapy, especially highlighting the activation and processing of relational schemas and other memories in the context of attachment neurocircuitry. Both intellectually stimulating and focused on real-world interventions, this book has dramatically increased my appreciation of the underlying neuroscientific basis of art therapy. This is an exciting, nearly quantum leap forward in our understanding of the power of expressive therapies.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>John Briere, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Psychology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Hass-Cohen and Findlay have created a bridge that links art therapy and neuroscience in a creative and practical way. As an art therapy educator and clinician, this book is an invaluable tool for helping my students, clients, and their families understand how art therapy naturally aligns with systems of the brain to heal the mind. Their rounded approach is anchored as much in art and relationships as it is in empirically supported brain science. For art therapists who want to learn more about neuroscience but remain uncertain as to what such integration has to do with their daily work, this is an essential text. The authors do not rely upon neuroscience as a silver bullet for the legitimization of art therapy; they move beyond science-versus-art arguments towards collaborative frontiers that are still unfolding.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Christopher M.

Written by leading experts in the field of LGBT health in conjunction with The Fenway Institute at Fenway Health, one of the most trusted and respected community-based research, education, and care centers, this edition continues to present the important issues facing patients and practitioners, including: Principles for taking an LGBT-inclusive health history Caring for LGBTQ youth, families, and older adults Behavioral Health Care: coming out, intimate partner violence, drug, alcohol, and tobacco use Understanding health care needs of transgender people Development of gender identity in children and adolescents Sexual health and HIV prevention Policy and legal issues The Fenway Guide to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health, 2nd edition is a must-have resource for clinicians, students, and researchers working in hospitals, clinics, universities, libraries, and private practices in every community.</p><p>New Edition of Fenway Guide to LGBT Health Includes HIV Updates The American College of Physicians (ACP) has released the second edition of The Fenway Guide to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health, according to an ACP press release. The textbook contains 80 percent new content and is written for clinicians, public health professionals, researchers and policy makers. Among the health topics relevant to LGBT people, the guide addresses the latest advances in HIV/AIDS prevention as well as the prevalence of HIV among young men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender people, notably those of minority communities. Fenway Health and its research arm Fenway Institute serve the LGBT and HIV communities in Boston s Fenway neighborhood. The guide is edited by Harvey Makadon, MD, Kenneth Mayer, MD, and Hilary Goldhammer, MS, of the Fenway Institute, and Jennifer Potter, MD, of Fenway Health and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. --POZ.com<br><br>The American College of Physicians (ACP) today released the second edition of The Fenway Guide to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health during its annual scientific meeting, Internal Medicine Meeting 2015. The textbook is edited by Dr. Harvey Makadon, Dr. Ken Mayer, and Hilary Goldhammer of The Fenway Institute at Fenway Health, and Dr. Jennifer Potter of Fenway Health and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Written for clinicians, students, public health professionals, researchers, and policymakers about the unique health care needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, its goal is to help the health care community in making their practices welcoming, inclusive of, and educated about LGBT patients. The new edition has been updated, with approximately 80 percent new content, to address the clinical and social changes that have emerged over the past eight years, since the first edition was published. We are pleased to publish this significantly updated Fenway Guide to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health, said Dr. David Fleming, president, ACP. The book is a valuable resource that addresses common health disparities experienced by LGBT patients and how health care providers, students, and trainees of all disciplines and specialties of medicine, along with researchers, policymakers and public health professionals can improve the health of this population. In addition to having the same basic health needs as the general population, LGBT individuals often experience disparities in health and access to health care. For example: LGBT youth are at increased risk of homelessness, bullying and victimization, and suicide attempts; LGBT people smoke at much higher rates than the general population; they also may be more likely to use alcohol and drugs; Young men who have sex with men and transgender women are infected with HIV at alarming rates, and need better access to prevention and care for HIV and sexually transmitted infections; LGBT people may experience a high burden of depression, anxiety, and self-harm behaviors often due to social minority stressors; Lesbian and bisexual women are less likely to receive preventive screening for cervical cancer than heterosexual women; Transgender people experience discrimination in health care and bear a high burden of trauma and suicide. As medical and public health providers, it is our responsibility to be familiar with emerging LGBT health issues so that we are delivering high quality care in an environment that is welcoming and inclusive, said Dr. Makadon, director of the National LGBT Health Education Center at The Fenway Institute and clinical professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Without feeling affirmed, people will not come for prevention or care. We must facilitate dialogue about behaviors and situations that result in these health care disparities so that patients are comfortable being honest and open with us. Communication between physicians and patients is fundamental to providing quality health care. The Fenway Guide contains chapters on subjects covering the lifecourse, including chapters on coming out, caring for youth, family and relationships, and aging. Other topics in this edition include emerging LGBT global health issues, new standards for comprehensive care of transgender people, behavioral health, gender identity development in children and teens, sexual health, and advances in HIV/AIDS prevention, particularly for sexual and gender minorities. The book is designed for individual usage, and also can be used as a tool for teaching a LGBT health curriculum; chapters can also be used separately in various educational contexts. --LGBTWeekly.com<br><br>We are excited to announce that the newest edition of The Fenway Guide to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health is now available for pre-order!

Arthur</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at McMaster University. </p><p>&#x201c;Richard Arthur&#x2019;s book offers a fresh new perspective on the pedagogy of introductory logic instruction and its underlying philosophy. Its approach makes informal logic and critical thinking mesh smoothly and intuitively with formal logic, thus clarifying the relevance of formal logic to the assessment of natural argument. My experience of teaching from the first edition was very positive; the book genuinely makes a majority of students build an appetite for logic. With its many conceptual, technical, and pedagogical improvements, the second edition should prove to be a sound choice as an introductory logic text.&#x201d; &#x2015; Nicolas Fillion, Simon Fraser University </p> <p> <strong>Praise for the first edition:</strong> </p> <p>&#x201c;This excellent text covers all the standard topics and more. Its real strength lies in the clarity and humour of exposition and in the richness of examples and exercises. The illustrations are invariably interesting, since often they are related to current events or the history of philosophy and science or are drawn from Monty Python. The last of these provides several memorable fallacies.

Drawing upon the history of literature and art from the mid-nineteenth century to the present, Bourdieu develops an original theory of art conceived as an autonomous value. He argues powerfully against those who refuse to acknowledge the interconnection between art and the structures of social relations within which it is produced and received. As Bourdieu shows, art&#x2019;s new autonomy is one such structure, which complicates but does not eliminate the interconnection. The literary universe as we know it today took shape in the nineteenth century as a space set apart from the approved academies of the state. No one could any longer dictate what ought to be written or decree the canons of good taste. Recognition and consecration were produced in and through the struggle in which writers, critics, and publishers confronted one another.</p><p>&#x201c;A major, pathbreaking work, The Rules of Art will stimulate theoretical debates for years to come.&#x201d;&#x2014;Le Nouvel Observateur<br>&#x201c;The Rules of Art is consistently interesting, sometimes enthrallingly so. It is written with a clarity not commonly encountered in French writers on art, and with an irascible authority to which Bourdieu&#x2019;s acuity and learning certainly entitle him.&#x201d;&#x2014;Arthur C.

Although new techniques allow us to forecast the weather with increasing accuracy, most people do not realize the vast global movements and forces which result in their day-to-day weather.<br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction,</em> Storm Dunlop explains what weather is and how it differs from climate, discussing what causes weather, and how we measure it. Analyzing the basic features and properties of the atmosphere, he shows how these are directly related to the weather experienced on the ground, and to specific weather phenomena and extreme weather events. He describes how the global patterns of temperature and pressure give rise to the overall circulation within the atmosphere, the major wind systems, and the major oceanic currents, and how features such as mountains and the sea affect local weather. He also looks at examples of extreme and dangerous weather, such as of tropical cyclones (otherwise known as hurricanes and typhoons), describing how "Hurricane Hunters" undertake the dangerous task of flying through them.<br><br>We measure weather in a number of ways: observations taken on the land and sea; observations within the atmosphere; and measurements from orbiting satellites. Dunlop concludes by looking at how these observations have been used to develop increasingly sophisticated long and short-range weather forecasting, including ensemble forecasting.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong> The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

This volume makes a compelling case for vocational reflection and discernment in undergraduate education today, arguing that it will encourage faculty and students alike to venture out of their narrow disciplinary specializations and to reflect on larger questions of meaning and purpose.<br><br>In conversation with a growing range of scholarly resources, these essays advance the cause of vocational reflection and discernment well beyond its occasional mention in general education courses and career placement offices. The book's thirteen contributors all work in higher education, but they do so as biologists and musicians, sociologists and engineers, doctors and lawyers, college presidents and deans, and scholars of history, literature, and business administration. Together, they demonstrate that vocation has an important role to play across the entire range of traditional academic disciplines and applied fields. Regardless of major, all undergraduates need to consider their current and future responsibilities, determine the stories they will live by, and discover resources for addressing the tensions that will inevitably arise among their multiple callings. <br><br><em>Vocation across the Academy</em> will help to reframe current debates about the purpose of higher education. It underscores the important role that colleges and universities can play in encouraging students to reflect more deeply on life's most persistent questions and to consider how they might best contribute to the common good.<br></p><p><br><strong>David S.

After the breakdown of this previously prospering area of psychopharmacology, and in the wake of clashes between counterculture and establishment in the late 1960s, a new generation of hallucinogen researchers used the hype around the neurosciences in the 1990s to bring psychedelics back into the mainstream of science and society. This book is based on anthropological fieldwork and philosophical reflections on life and work in two laboratories that have played key roles in this development: a human lab in Switzerland and an animal lab in California. It sheds light on the central transnational axis of the resurgence connecting American psychedelic culture with the home country of LSD. In the borderland of science and religion, <i>Neuropsychedelia </i>explores the tensions between the use of hallucinogens to model psychoses and to evoke spiritual experiences in laboratory settings. Its protagonists, including the anthropologist himself, struggle to find a place for the mystical under conditions of late-modern materialism.</p><p>"Langlitz's fieldwork in cutting-edge neuroscience laboratories is a much-needed scholarly work on the neglected area of psychedelic drugs and what these drugs can tell us about ourselves.

In telling the stories of pioneering researchers, Altman offers a history of many of the most important medical advancements in recent years as well as centuries past&#x2015;from anesthesia to yellow fever to heart disease. With a new preface, he brings readers up to date and continues his discussion of the ethics and controversy that continue to surround a practice that benefits millions but is understood by few.</p><p>"Medical research." When most of us hear those words, our imagination conjures up bored graduates with white jackets in a sterile porcelain laboratory, knowing no more about their subjects than ID number and blood type. This depersonalization of modern science is a myth, of course, but a powerful one that guides the way science is perceived and performed. This myth neglects or marginalizes the work of those men and women who take the human aspects of their research so seriously that they feel compelled to experiment on themselves. <i>Who Goes First?</i> tells their stories and thus gives us a view of medical research that diverges from the alienation of the nameless number heads.<p> Lawrence K. Altman has pursued research on the subject of medical self-experimentation since his days as a medical student, and this personal interest shines throughout the book. His writing is smart and enthusiastic, shedding light on a little-discussed aspect of research that raises important questions of ethics and scientific validity. Can a researcher be as objective about his or her own reactions to a drug as to a stranger's reactions? Should a scientist subject others to risks that he or she wouldn't take personally? What, if anything, do we have to gain from self-experimentation?</p><p> As you might imagine, this book is not for the squeamish.

Translation doesn't only give us foreign news, dubbed films and instructions for using the microwave: without it, there would be no world religions, and our literatures, our cultures, and our languages would be unrecognizable. <br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, Matthew Reynolds gives an authoritative and thought-provoking account of the field, from ancient Akkadian to World English, from St Jerome to Google Translate. He shows how translation determines meaning, how it matters in commerce, empire, conflict and resistance, and why it is fundamental to literature and the arts. <br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong> The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

You should be able to define the mission in sufficient detail to identify principal drivers and make a preliminary assessment of overall performance, size, cost, and risk. The emphasis of the book is on low-Earth orbit, unmanned spacecraft. However, we hope that the principles are broad enough to be applicable to other missions as well. We intend the book to be a practical guide, rather than a theoretical treatise. As much as possible, we have provided rules of thumb, empirical formulas, and design algorithms based on past experience. We assume that the reader has a general knowledge of physics, math, and basic engineering, but is not necessarily familiar with any aspect of space technology. This book was written by a group of senior engineers with over 800 years of collective space experience. It reflects the insight gained from this practical experience, and suggests how things might be done better in the future. From time to time the views of authors and editors conflict, as must necessarily occur given the broad diversity of experience. We believe it is important to reflect this diversity rather than suppress the opinions of individual authors.</p><p><em>But as a reference volume for system engineers and satellite designers</em> <em>it would appear to be an invaluable collection of data.</em> <br> <strong>The Aeronautical Journal</strong> <br></p><h2>Essential Psychopathology Casebook</h2><p><p><strong>A problem-based learning casebook, keyed to the newly released DSM-V.</strong></p> The clinical cases in this book are about real people suffering from psychopathology.

Descriptions of early operations include a harrowing account of the heroic efforts of pad workers during the <i>Apollo 1</i> fire. A companion to the author&#x2019;s book <i>Countdown to a Moon Launch: </i><i>Preparing Apollo for Its Historic Journey</i>, this explores every facet of the facilities that served as the base for the Apollo/Saturn missions. Hundreds of illustrations complement the firsthand accounts of more than 70 Apollo program managers and engineers. </p><p></p><p>The era of the Apollo/Saturn missions was perhaps the most exciting period in American space exploration history. Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Center were buzzing with activity. Thousands of workers came to town to build the facilities and launch the missions needed to put an American on the Moon before the end of the decade. </p><p>Work at KSC involved much more than just launching rockets. It was a place like none other on Earth. Technicians performed intricate operations, and hazards abounded everywhere, including lightning, fire, highly-toxic fuels, snakes, heat, explosives, LOX spills, and even plutonium. The reward for months of 7-day workweeks under intense pressure was witnessing a Saturn V at liftoff.</p><p></p><p>For anyone who ever wished they had worked at Kennedy Space Center during the Apollo era, this book is the next best thing. The only thing missing is the smell of rocket fuel in the morning.</p></p><p><p>American author Jonathan Ward spent several years of his childhood in Japan, but he considers the Virginia suburbs of Washington, D. C. to be his hometown. Although he has a wide variety of interests and has worked in many fields, space exploration is his lifelong passion. His joy of bringing the space program to life for the general public began in high school, when he served as a volunteer tour guide at the National Air and Space Museum during the Apollo 15 and 16 missions. He continues his public outreach today, as a Solar System Ambassador for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as a frequent speaker on space exploration topics to interest groups and at regional conferences and as an author for Springer-Praxis. Jonathan is also a frequent contributor to online space exploration forums.</p><p>Jonathan brings a unique perspective to his writing that marries a systems view of the topic, fascination with the technology, passion for space exploration and deep respect for the people who make it all happen. He holds an MS in Systems Management from the University of Denver and a BS in Psychology from Virginia Commonwealth University. He is professionally certified as an executive coach by the International Coach Federation, and serves on the adjunct faculty at the Center for Creative Leadership. His professional experience includes extensive work with leadership teams and several years with Boeing on the Space Station Freedom program. </p><p>Jonathan and his wife Jane now reside in Greensboro, North Carolina. He is fiercely proud of his two grown children and their families and he wishes they lived closer to him. He maintains a website to document his research on the Apollo era at Kennedy Space Center. He collects and restores artefacts from the Apollo era, including several control panels from the Firing Rooms. Jonathan also notes that he might possibly be the only current space author who has appeared on two GRAMMY-winning albums, which were recorded during his years as a Bass II section leader, soloist and eventually president of The Washington Chorus.</p>"A treat for space fans...the books are both great resources and good, solid reads." <i>Spaceflight Insider</i></p><h2>Working with Families of Young Children with Special Needs (What Works for Special-Needs Learners)</h2><p><p>This user-friendly book presents research-based best practices for serving families of children with special needs from birth to age 6.

Writing programs is much more difficult than reading them, and the first step is just letting your fingers get used to typing in the programs and getting rid of the small syntax errors that inevitably occur. As you get deeper into the book, you&#x2019;ll be writing programs that are pretty tricky to write in most other languages-- but hopefully you won&#x2019;t realize this.

Booklist</p><h2>Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet</h2><p>Life on the Screen is a book not about computers, but about people and how computers are causing us to reevaluate our identities in the age of the Internet. We are using life on the screen to engage in new ways of thinking about evolution, relationships, politics, sex, and the self. Life on the Screen traces a set of boundary negotiations, telling the story of the changing impact of the computer on our psychological lives and our evolving ideas about minds, bodies, and machines. What is emerging, Turkle says, is a new sense of identity- as decentered and multiple. She describes trends in computer design, in artificial intelligence, and in people&#39;s experiences of virtual environments that confirm a dramatic shift in our notions of self, other, machine, and world. The computer emerges as an object that brings postmodernism down to earth.</p><p>Sherry Turkle is rapidly becoming the sociologist of the Internet, and that's beginning to seem like a good thing. While her first outing, <i>The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit</i>, made groundless assertions and seemed to be carried along more by her affection for certain theories than by a careful look at our current situation, <i>Life on the Screen</i> is a balanced and nuanced look at some of the ways that cyberculture helps us comment upon real life (what the cybercrowd sometimes calls RL). Instead of giving in to any one theory on construction of identity, Turkle looks at the way various netizens have used the Internet, and especially MUDs (Multi-User Dimensions), to learn more about the possibilities available in apprehending the world. One of the most interesting sections deals with gender, a topic prone to rash and partisan pronouncements. Taking as her motto William James's maxim "Philosophy is the art of imagining alternatives," Turkle shows how playing with gender in cyberspace can shape a person's real-life understanding of gender. Especially telling are the examples of the man who finds it easier to be assertive when playing a woman, because he believes male assertiveness is now frowned upon while female assertiveness is considered hip, and the woman who has the opposite response, believing that it is easier to be aggressive when she plays a male, because as a woman she would be considered "bitchy." Without taking sides, Turkle points out how both have expanded their emotional range. Other topics, such as artificial life, receive an equally calm and sage response, and the first-person accounts from many Internet users provide compelling reading and good source material for readers to draw their own conclusions.Sherry Turkle is Professor of the Sociology of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><h2>The Deeper Dimension of Yoga: Theory and Practice</h2><p>Here is a comprehensive survey of the full breadth and depth of the 5,000-year-old Yoga tradition, emphasizing its potent philosophy and spiritual vision. Georg Feuerstein demonstrates that Yoga is much more than a system of physical exercises&#x2014;it is a profound path of self-transformation that encompasses a range of teachings, practices, and sacred texts that can help us cultivate wisdom, balance, and inner freedom, as well as physical health. <br><br>Feuerstein is one of the few Western scholar-teachers of Yoga whose writing and teaching penetrate the full richness and depth of this ancient tradition. Here he offers a collection of essays touching on all facets of the discipline. <br><br>Topics include: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The different branches and styles of Yoga <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The ethical teachings of Yoga <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Yoga and vegetarianism <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Meditation and mantras <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Choosing a teacher <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Tantric Yoga <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The experience of ecstasy</p><p>Georg Feuerstein, PhD, (1947&#x2013;2012) is internationally respected for his work on Yoga and is the author of over fifty books. He designed and taught several distance-learning courses on Yoga philosophy for Traditional Yoga Studies. For more information, go to www.traditionalyogastudies.com.Feuerstein is a respected scholar as well as a longtime yoga practioner and author of numerous books on the topic. His latest is a comprehensive guide to the history and current practices of yoga. Feuerstein has an incredible breadth of knowledge on the subject of yoga, and he masterfully synthesizes material from both well-known and esoteric yogic texts in explaining numerous paths of yoga. Ultimately, his thoughtful reflections on various yogic and Buddhist practices help the reader understand the spiritual context of yoga practice and its relevance to twenty-first-century life. <i>Jane Tuma</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

How can we know whether a memory is true or false? Seven spellbinding cases shed light on why it is rare for a reclaimed memory to be wholly false. Here are unforgettable true stories of what happens when people remember what they've tried to forget&#x2014;plus one case of genuine false memory. In the best detective-story fashion, using her insights as a psychiatrist and the latest research on the mind and the brain, Lenore Terr helps us separate truth from fiction.</p><p><b>Lenore Terr, M.D.,</b> is a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute at the University of California, San Francisco. She is the winner of the Blanche Ittleson Award for her research on childhood trauma.Artfully told stories of the often-astonishing discovery of memories of traumatic childhood events. A child psychiatrist well-versed in trauma and memory, Terr has studied victims' recollection of the Chowchilla schoolbus kidnapping (Too scared to Cry, 1990) and child witnesses' memories of the Challenger disaster. Here, her research on trauma and memory enriches her narrative, making it far more than good journalism. The first and longest account concerns Eileen Lipsker, who suddenly and vividly recalled seeing her father kill her childhood playmate 20 years earlier (Terr came to know Lipsker when appearing as an expert witness for the prosecution in the murder trial of Lipsker's father). In two other accounts, Terr was a witness for the defense, explaining old-fashioned psychological amnesia to one jury and false memories to another. In the first, the defendant had suffered episodes of amnesia since seeing her mother burn to death, and in the second, a young girl had falsely accused her doctors of sexual abuse. Child abuse figures in two other stories--one involving a man whose repressed memories of his mother sexually abusing him and attempting to drown him returned with terrifying force, another about a former Miss America overwhelmed by the return of memories of incest. Shorter accounts describe how James Ellroy, author of Black Dahlia and other violent crime novels, had displaced memories of his own mother's brutal slaying, and how a radio talk-show host succeeded in recalling memories of a long-dead brother. Terr interviewed all but the young girl, whom she studied via audio and video tapes, and for each interview she includes convincing data on trauma and memory to clarify their stories. First-rate medical detection that lights up a corner of the human mind. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Generations ago, the seemingly immortal wizard Od saved the city of Numis from destruction, not out of altruism but because it seemed like a nice place to found a school of magic. Over the years, the practice of magic has come more and more under the king's control. Deciding to stir things up, Od recruits Brenden Vetch, a gardener from the northlands with tremendous raw power and no taste for politics. As Brenden arrives in Numis, so does a fabulous street magician, Tyramin, whose sleight-of-hand looks suspiciously like unauthorized wizardry. King Galin's attempts to control Brendan and arrest Tyramin only scare them away and earn him the scorn of his daughter, Sulys.

A literal combination of the German words for &#x201c;cheese&#x201d; and &#x201c;beer,&#x201d; it&#x2019;s an unglamorous name for an unglamorous man&#x2014;a small-time crooner who performs nightly on a shabby stage for laborers, secretaries, and shopkeepers. Until the press shows up.<br><br> In the blink of an eye, this everyman is made a star: a star who can sing songs for a troubled time. Margot Weissmann, the arts patron, hosts champagne breakfasts for K�sebier; Muschler the banker builds a theater in his honor; Willi Fr�chter, a parvenu writer, makes a mint off K�sebier-themed business ventures and books. All the while, the journalists who catapulted K�sebier to fame watch the monstrous media machine churn in amazement&#x2014;and are aghast at the demons they have unleashed.<br><br>In <i>K�sebier Takes Berlin</i>, the journalist Gabriele Tergit wrote a searing satire of the excesses and follies of the Weimar Republic. Chronicling a country on the brink of fascism and a press on the edge of collapse, Tergit&#x2019;s novel caused a sensation when it was published in 1931. As witty as Kurt Tucholsky and as trenchant as Karl Kraus, Tergit portrays a world too entranced by fireworks to notice its smoldering edges.</p><p><b>Gabriele Tergit </b>(1894&#x2013;1982) was a novelist and journalist, known initially for her courtroom reporting. After gaining fame for <i>K�sebier Takes Berlin</i>, her writing career was cut short when the Nazis rose to power in 1933. She immediately fled to Czechoslovakia, then Palestine, and finally London. After the war, her work was largely forgotten by the public, but she continued to work on behalf of other authors as the honorary secretary of the London PEN Centre of expatriate German-speaking authors.<br><br><b>Sophie Duvernoy</b> has translated work by Sibylle Berg, Sabine Rennefanz, and Zora del Buono, and has written for the <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>, <i>Thomson Reuters</i>, and other publications.

Now, with Evening, she gives us her most ambitious novel, a work of surpassing beauty. During a summer weekend on the coast of Maine, at the wedding of her best friend, Ann Grant fell in love. She was twenty-five. Forty years later--after three marriages and five children--Ann Lord finds herself in the dim claustrophobia of illness, careening between lucidity and delirium and only vaguely conscious of the friends and family parading by her bedside, when the memory of that weekend returns to her with the clarity and intensity of a fever-dream. <b>Evening</b> unfolds in the rushlight of that memory, as Ann relives those three vivid days on the New England coast, with motorboats buzzing and bands playing in the night, and the devastating tragedy that followed a spectacular wedding. Here, in the surge of hope and possibility that coursed through her at twenty-five--in a singular time of complete surrender--Ann discovers the highest point of her life. Superbly written and miraculously uplifting, <b>Evening</b> is a stirring exploration of time and memory, of love's transcendence and of its failure to transcend--a rich testament to the depths of grief and passion, and a stunning achievement.</p><p>As Ann Lord lies on her deathbed, her daughter delivers a balsam pillow from the attic. At first the ailing woman is confused, but suddenly the scent reminds her of the "wild tumult" she experienced 40 years earlier: <blockquote> Something stole into her as she walked in the dark, a dream she'd had long ago. The air was so black she was unable to see her arms, it was a warm summer night. Above her she could make out the dark line of the tops of spruce trees and a sky lit with stars. She felt the warm tar through the soles of her shoes. The boy beside her took her hand. </blockquote> In the porous world between conscious and unconscious the protagonist of <i>Evening</i> revisits the great passions of her life, along with its considerable disappointments. The boy in the dark remains the fixed point--not so much because he is the most important man in her life, but because of the untapped possibilities he represents. Meanwhile, friends and relations come to sit by Ann Lord's side as she veers between clarity and feverish recollection.<p> In her third novel, Susan Minot takes some new risks--her narrative spanning seven decades of memory and her style ranging from Stegneresque particularity to the exquisite abstraction Virginia Woolf perfected in <i>To the Lighthouse</i>.

Despite her flapping arms and shaking legs, she continued to speak clearly and was able to finish her speech. It was as if she had suddenly become two people: a calm orator and a shuddering wreck. Then the seizures happened again and again. </p><p><i>The Shaking Woman</i> tracks Hustvedt's search for a diagnosis, one that takes her inside the thought processes of several scientific disciplines, each one of which offers a distinct perspective on her paroxysms but no ready solution. In the process, she finds herself entangled in fundamental questions: What is the relationship between brain and mind? How do we remember? What is the self? </p><p>During her investigations, Hustvedt joins a discussion group in which neurologists, psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, and brain scientists trade ideas to develop a new field: neuropsychoanalysis.

She lives in Brooklyn with her husband, Paul Auster.<p>THE SHAKING WOMAN OR A HISTORY OF MY NERVES </p><p>WHEN MY FATHER DIED, I was at home in Brooklyn, but only days before I had been sitting beside his bed in a nursing home in Northfield, Minnesota. Although he was weak in body, his mind remained sharp, and I remember that we talked and even laughed, though I can&#x2019;t recall the content of our last conversation. I can, however, clearly see the room where he lived at the end of his life. My three sisters, my mother, and I had hung pictures on the wall and bought a pale green bedspread to make the room less stark. There was a vase of flowers on the windowsill. My father had emphysema, and we knew he would not last long. My sister Liv, who lives in Minnesota, was the only daughter with him on the final day. His lung had collapsed for the second time, and the doctor understood that he would not survive another intervention. While he was still conscious, but unable to speak, my mother called her three daughters in New York City, one by one, so we could talk to him on the telephone. I distinctly remember that I paused to think about what I should say to him. I had the curious thought that I should not utter something stupid at such a moment, that I should choose my words carefully. I wanted to say something memorable&#x2014;an absurd thought, because my father&#x2019;s memory would soon be snuffed out with the rest of him. But when my mother put the telephone to his ear, all I could do was choke out the words &#x201c;I love you so much.&#x201d; Later, my mother told me that when he heard my voice, he smiled. </p><p>That night I dreamed that I was with him and he reached out for me, that I fell toward him for an embrace, and then, before he could put his arms around me, I woke up. My sister Liv called me the next morning to say that our father was dead. Immediately after that conversation, I stood up from the chair where I had been sitting, climbed the stairs to my study, and sat down to write his eulogy. My father had asked me to do it. Several weeks earlier, when I was sitting beside him in the nursing home, he had mentioned &#x201c;three points&#x201d; he wanted me to take down. He didn&#x2019;t say, &#x201c;I want you to include them in the text you will write for my funeral.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t have to. It was understood. When the time came, I didn&#x2019;t weep. I wrote. At the funeral I delivered my speech in a strong voice, without tears. </p><p>TWO AND A HALF YEARS LATER, I gave another talk in honor of my father. I was back in my hometown, in Minnesota, standing under a blue May sky on the St. Olaf College campus, just beyond the old building that housed the Norwegian Department, where my father had been a professor for almost forty years. The department had planted a memorial pine tree with a small plaque beneath it that read, LLOYD HUSTVEDT (1922&#x2013;2004). While I&#x2019;d been writing this second text, I&#x2019;d had a strong sensation of hearing my father&#x2019;s voice. He wrote excellent and often very funny speeches, and as I composed I imagined that I had caught some of his humor in my sentences. I even used the phrase &#x201c;Were my father here today, he might have said...&#x201d; Confident and armed with index cards, I looked out at the fifty or so friends and colleagues of my father&#x2019;s who had gathered around the memorial Norway spruce, launched into my first sentence, and began to shudder violently from the neck down. My arms flapped. My knees knocked. I shook as if I were having a seizure. Weirdly, my voice wasn&#x2019;t affected. It didn&#x2019;t change at all. Astounded by what was happening to me and terrified that I would fall over, I managed to keep my balance and continue, despite the fact that the cards in my hands were flying back and forth in front of me. When the speech ended, the shaking stopped. I looked down at my legs. They had turned a deep red with a bluish cast. </p><p>My mother and sisters were startled by the mysterious bodily transformation that had taken place within me. They had seen me speak in public many times, sometimes in front of hundreds of people. Liv said she had wanted to go over and put her arms around me to hold me up. My mother said she had felt as if she were looking at an electrocution. It appeared that some unknown force had suddenly taken over my body and decided I needed a good, sustained jolting. Once before, during the summer of 1982, I&#x2019;d felt as if some superior power picked me up and tossed me about as if I were a doll. In an art gallery in Paris, I suddenly felt my left arm jerk upward and slam me backward into the wall. The whole event lasted no more than a few seconds. Not long after that, I felt euphoric, filled with supernatural joy, and then came the violent migraine that lasted for almost a year, the year of Fiorinal, Inderal, cafergot, Elavil, Tofranil, and Mellaril, of a sleeping-drug cocktail I took in the doctor&#x2019;s office in hopes that I would wake up headache-free. No such luck. Finally, that same neurologist sent me to the hospital and put me on the antipsychotic drug Thorazine. Those eight stuporous days in the neurology ward with my old but surprisingly agile roommate, a stroke victim, who every night was strapped to her bed with a restraint sweetly known as a Posey, and who every night defied the nurses by escaping her fetters and fleeing down the corridor, those strange drugged days, punctuated by visits from young men in white coats who held up pencils for me to identify, asked me the day and the year and the name of the president, pricked me with little needles&#x2014;Can you feel this?&#x2014;and the rare wave through the door from the Headache Czar himself, Dr. C., a man who mostly ignored me and seemed irritated that I didn&#x2019;t cooperate and get well, have stayed with me as a time of the blackest of all black comedies. Nobody really knew what was wrong with me. My doctor gave it a name&#x2014;vascular migraine syndrome&#x2014;but why I had become a vomiting, miserable, flattened, frightened ENORMOUS headache, a Humpty Dumpty after his fall, no one could say. </p><p>My travels in the worlds of neurology, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis began well before my stint in Mount Sinai Medical Center. I have suffered from migraines since childhood and have long been curious about my own aching head, my dizziness, my divine lifting feelings, my sparklers and black holes, and my single visual hallucination of a little pink man and a pink ox on the floor of my bedroom. I had been reading about these mysteries for many years before I had my shaking fit that afternoon in Northfield. But my investigations intensified when I decided to write a novel in which I would have to impersonate a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, a man I came to think of as my imaginary brother, Erik Davidsen. Brought up in Minnesota by parents very much like mine, he was the boy never born to the Hustvedt family. To be Erik, I threw myself into the convolutions of psychiatric diagnoses and the innumerable mental disorders that afflict human beings. I studied pharmacology and familiarized myself with the various classes of drugs. I bought a book with sample tests for the New York State psychiatric boards and practiced taking them. I read more psychoanalysis and countless memoirs of mental illness. I found myself fascinated by neuroscience, attended a monthly lecture on brain science at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute, and was invited to become a member of a discussion group devoted to a new field: neuropsychoanalysis. </p><p>In that group, neuroscientists, neurologists, psychiatrists, and psychoanalysts sought a common ground that might bring together the insights of analysis with the most recent brain research. I bought myself a rubber brain, familiarized myself with its many parts, listened intently, and read more. In fact, I read obsessively, as my husband has told me repeatedly. He has even suggested that my rapacious reading resembles an addiction. Then I signed up as a volunteer at the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic and began teaching a writing class to the patients there every week. At the hospital, I found myself close to particular human beings who suffered from complex illnesses that sometimes bore little resemblance to the descriptions cataloged in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (usually referred to as the DSM). By the time I shook in front of my father&#x2019;s tree, I had been steeped in the world of the brain/mind for years. What began with curiosity about the mysteries of my own nervous system had developed into an overriding passion. Intellectual curiosity about one&#x2019;s own illness is certainly born of a desire for mastery. If I couldn&#x2019;t cure myself, perhaps I could at least begin to understand myself. </p><p>EVERY SICKNESS HAS an alien quality, a feeling of invasion and loss of control that is evident in the language we use about it. No one says, &#x201c;I am cancer&#x201d; or even &#x201c;I am cancerous,&#x201c; despite the fact that there is no intruding virus or bacteria; it&#x2019;s the body&#x2019;s own cells that have run amok. One has cancer. Neurological and psychiatric illnesses are different, however, because they often attack the very source of what one imagines is one&#x2019;s self. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s an epileptic&#x201d; doesn&#x2019;t sound strange to us. In the psychiatric clinic, the patients often say, &#x201c;Well, you see, I&#x2019;m bipolar&#x201d; or &#x201c;I&#x2019;m schizophrenic.&#x201d; The illness and the self are fully identified in these sentences. The shaking woman felt like me and not like me at the same time. From the chin up, I was my familiar self. From the neck down, I was a shuddering stranger. What ever had happened to me, what ever name would be assigned to my affliction, my strange seizure must have had an emotional component that was somehow connected to my father. The problem was that I hadn&#x2019;t felt emotional. I had felt entirely calm and reasonable. Something seemed to have gone terribly wrong with me, but what exactly? I decided to go in search of the shaking woman. </p><p>PHYSICIANS HAVE BEEN PUZZLING over convulsions like mine for centuries. Many diseases can make you shudder, ...</p></p><h2>Funk the Erotic: Transaesthetics and Black Sexual Cultures (New Black Studies Series)</h2><p>Funk. It is multisensory and multidimensional philosophy used in conjunction with the erotic, eroticism, and black erotica. It is the affect that shapes film, performance, sound, food, technology, drugs, energy, time, and the seeds of revolutionary ideas for black movements. But funk is also an experience to feel, to hear, to touch and taste, and in Funk the Erotic , L. H. Stallings uses funk in all its iterations as an innovation in black studies. Stallings uses funk to highlight the importance of the erotic and eroticism in Black cultural and political movements, debunking &#34;the truth of sex&#34; and its histories. Brandishing funk as a theoretical tool, Stallings argues that Western theories of the erotic fail as universally applicable terms or philosophies, and thus lack utility in discussions of black bodies, subjects, and culture. In considering the Victorian concept of freak in black funk, Stallings proposes that black artists across all media have fashioned a tradition that embraces the superfreak, sexual guerrilla, sexual magic, mama&#39;s porn, black trans narratives, and sex work in a post-human subject position. Their goal: to ensure survival and evolution in a world that exploits black bodies in capitalist endeavors, imperialism, and colonization. Revitalizing and wide-ranging, Funk the Erotic offers a needed examination of black sexual cultures, a discursive evolution of black ideas about eroticism, a critique of work society, a reexamination of love, and an articulation of the body in black movements.</p><p>Freeing your mind so the funk can followL.H.

He was a cowboy, Indian fighter, trail driver, stock detective, rancher, and deadly shootist who killed more adversaries than did such noted gunfighters as Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and Bat Masterson. Pink battled Comanches and rustlers, and led a faction in the murderous Horrell-Higgins feud of Lampasas County (Texas). Yet he was a hard-working family man, devoted to his nine children. His son, Cullen Higgins, as a lawyer and judge, would become entangled in a series of bloody events involving a powerful cattle baron and the legendary Texas Ranger Frank Hamer. In this, the first book-length biography of Pink Higgins, the author reveals never before published details about the violence that followed the Higgins family to West Texas.</p><p></p><h2>Mhudi</h2><p>South African novelist Sol T Plaatje (1876-1932) was a pioneer in the fight against racism in his country. He labored as a political activist to advance governmental reforms and promote civil rights for oppressed blacks. His <i>Mhudi,</i> penned in 1919 20 but published in 1930, represents the first full-length novel in English by a black South African writer.<p> Today regarded as a classic for its skillful utilization of the African oral narrative and its robust validation of the positive qualities of African customs, the story of Mhudi, the harvester, and her romance with birdman Ra-Thaga is set during the country's cataclysmic wars of possession of the 1830s. Plaatje's heroine, Mhudi, is an enduring symbol of resilience of spirit and the belief in a new day.</p><p> "The humour and imagination which made Plaatje's journalistic labour and his advocacy of his people so fruitful and acceptable are enlivening features of his last work." <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i></p><p> <b>Other titles by African writers from Waveland Press:</b></p><p> Amadi, <i>The Concubine</i> (ISBN 9781478634607)</p><p> Andreas, <i>The Purple Violet of Oshaantu</i> (ISBN 9781478634584)</p><p> Ba, <i>So Long a Letter</i> (ISBN 9781577668060)</p><p> Campbell, <i>My Children Have Faces</i> (ISBN 13 9781478635017)</p><p> Head, <i>The Collector of Treasures and Other Botswana Village Tales</i> (ISBN 9781478607601)</p><p> Head, <i>Maru</i> (ISBN 9781478607618)</p><p> Head, <i>A Question of Power</i> (ISBN 9781478634690)</p><p> Head, <i> When Rain Clouds Gather</i> (ISBN 9781478607595)</p><p> Kubuitsile, <i>The Scattering</i> (ISBN 9781478634591)</p><p> La Guma, <i>In the Fog of the Seasons' End</i> (ISBN 9781478600251)</p><p> Nwapa, <i>Efuru</i> (ISBN 9781478611011)</p><p> p'Bitek, <i>Song of Lawino &amp; Song of Ocol</i> (ISBN 9781478604723)</p><p> Rifaat, <i>Distant Views of a Minaret and Other Short Stories</i> (ISBN 9781478611288)</p></p><p>"... much more than a story of tribal wars.

The banjo shares many of the same sonic qualities as a harpsichord, so although it&#39;s so closely associated with more homespun genres, the instrument actually lends itself very well to classical music! The pieces in Bach for Banjo are in tablature only with chord symbols, arranged at the beginning to intermediate level for five-string banjo players. As in classical guitar arrangements, the melody and harmony are combined. Most pieces are on facing pages with no page turns required, and beginners can pick through the selections at a slow pace. The book features just the best-known parts of 20 beloved Bach pieces: Air on the G String * Arioso * Minuet in G * Sheep May Safely Graze * Sleepers, Awake * and more.</p><p></p><h2>Grief Undone: A Journey with God and Cancer</h2><p>Foreword by Sinclair Ferguson.<br><br>"Grief Undone" is the breathtakingly honest, yet hopeful account of how Elizabeth (Libbie) and Al Groves walked with God through Al s terminal cancer. Their true story saturated with in-the-moment Scriptural reflections, blogs, and fervent prayers paints a stunning picture of how faith transforms the human experience of suffering.<br><br>But "Grief Undone" is more than the chronicle of one family s courage in the face of cancer. At its core, "Grief Undone" tells a story about the God who is with his people through each and every circumstance in life. Evangelistic in impact, though not in tone, "Grief Undone" will inevitably display the beauty of Christ s sustaining love for his people through trials that seemed too hard to bear. Though grief threatens to undo us, we find that we are not destroyed, but sustained by God s presence.<br><br>Story-driven and real, "Grief Undone" avoids the usual traps of being preachy, gratuitous, or dismissive in the face of suffering and grief. Modeling rather than teaching about healthy and God-honoring grief, Grief Undone is uniquely practical for those who are grieving as well as the pastors, counselors, and friends who seek to help them.</p><p>Elizabeth W. D. Groves, MAR, teaches Hebrew at Westminster Theological Seminary and is the author of the minibook Becoming a Widow: The Ache of Missing Your Other Half. She has four children, who were ages thirteen and up when her husband Al died in 2007, and two granddaughters born after his death.Most personal reflections on grief present unfiltered emotions packaged as honesty. Or they pass off sterile truths about God s sovereignty as marks of maturity. Grief Undone avoids those extremes. Libbie shares, and understands, her raw emotions in light of God s character. The result? Readers will discover that they have permission to grieve and that God can be trusted despite the intensity of their emotions. Grief Undone is a rare gift. --Samuel J. Hodges IV, Executive Producer, GriefShare<br><br>A lot of people write books about the loss of someone they love. Few are worth reading. This one is. Few combine honesty about the sorrow with insight into the Scripture. This one does. Few people face death holding both present sadness and future hope in their hearts at the same time. That s what Al and Libbie Groves did. And it is a beautiful thing to behold through the pages of this book. --Nancy Guthrie, Author of Hearing Jesus Speak into Your Sorrow<br><br>What do you say about a story when you know and love the people who lived and are living that story? Perhaps the most helpful thing I can say is this: Grief Undone tells the truth, in both senses of the word. It is honest true to life. And it is True true to Jesus. You can t say better about a book. --David Powlison Executive Director, CCEF; author<br><br>&#x201c;Here is what will happen as you read this book. You will learn more about how to love those who have lost someone, you will be loosened from your own calcifying grief, you will actually enjoy more of the love of God, you will notice hope growing, and you will cry&#x2014;mostly all at the same time.&#x201d;<br><br>Ed Welch, PhD, CCEF Faculty; psychologist; best-selling author<br><br>&#x201c;This is a painful, but hopeful book to read. For those of us privileged to have known Al and Libbie as a couple, this book is a poignant reminder of a lost friend. But it is more than that. It is also a powerful plea for the reader to take seriously the truth of the gospel and a trenchant reminder of how Jesus Christ stands with his people in even the darkest of times and will bring them ultimately through death to their eternal home.&#x201d;<br><br>Carl Trueman, Author; pastor; Paul Woolley Professor of Church History, Westminster Theological Seminary<br><br>&#x201c;The great privilege of this book is getting an inside look, a sneak peak at a real working faith. The juxtaposition of Al and Libbie's faith and the realities they are facing gives the book an unusual, vibrant feeling. This book is soul food at its finest.&#x201d;<br><br>Paul Miller, Director of seeJesus, author of A Loving Life<br><br>&#x201c;I will never forget Al Groves&#x2019;s huge memorial service. The congregation was singing a praise song from the book of Job: &#x2018;[God] gives and takes away; blessed be the name of the Lord.&#x2019; Libbie&#x2019;s hand was stretched toward heaven, palm upward in worship, yielding Al to God. In this book, she yields him again. These pages are a godly woman&#x2019;s poignant offering to Jesus of her dearest earthly friend.&#x201d;<br><br>Steve Estes, Pastor; author of A Better December and When God Weeps<br><br>&#x201c;Here is a down-to-earth account of death through cancer, but written as a journey with God. It is a heart-wrenching, honest, and moving account of the joys and regrets of caring for a husband dying of cancer. Written in such an engaging style, the author enables the reader both to resonate with her pain and to marvel at the grace and mercy of God that captivated her and her husband. I read. I wept. I gave thanks to God.&#x201d;<br><br>The Most Rev. Dr. Glenn N. Davies, Archbishop of Sydney, Australia<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2018;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.&#x2019; This promise of Christ is not only for the apostle Paul, as this volume so convincingly and winsomely evidences. Though written in a highly personal vein, it does not so much draw attention to the author as it does to Christ&#x2019;s sustaining and sanctifying sufficiency. Here is hope and encouragement for Christians undergoing similar circumstances. Grief Undone indeed.&#x201d;<br><br>Richard B. Gaffin, Jr., Professor of Biblical and Systematic Theology, Emeritus, Westminster Theological Seminary<br><br>&#x201c;Deepest joy and profoundest hope is often best seen through glistened eyes. This collection of brief but exceedingly poignant reflections on the death of one of the Lord&#x2019;s saints will have many readers thanking God with hearts weeping but overflowing because the subject is not ultimately Al&#x2019;s death or his family&#x2019;s journey through grief; it&#x2019;s about how the presence of Jesus bathes even the land of darkest sorrow in light.&#x201d;<br><br>Dan McCartney, Professor of New Testament Interpretation, Redeemer Theological Seminary<br><br>&#x201c;In Grief Undone, the reader is given the most honest and vivid picture of the walk through the valley of the shadow of death that I have ever read. There is the depth of both the valley and the darkness. But in these brief and engaging chapters there is also the constant presence of the Shepherd whose triumph over death gives the reader true comfort to believe that &#x2018;I need not fear for thou art with me.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>Dr. Tim Witmer, Professor of Practical Theology, Westminster Theological Seminary; pastor<br><br>&#x201c;This book offers a touching testament to the power of love over death, one that does more than merely chronicle the journey of J. Alan Groves&#x2019;s battle with cancer, but that beautifully articulates the broad range of feelings, moods, sentiments, and longings his family faced throughout its long, painful ordeal. Grief Undone tells a tale of one family&#x2019;s journey with cancer and how it sensed God&#x2019;s quiet, compassionate presence at every turn.&#x201d;<br><br>Rev. Dennis J. Billy, CSsR, John Cardinal Krol Chair of Moral Theology at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary<br><br>&#x201c;In this book Libbie expresses concern that she&#x2019;s not very open about what goes on inside or that she loves people well. Don&#x2019;t believe her. In her straightforward and down-to-earth way, she brings dying to life. She reveals the raw and the real within her own heart. She invites us into intimate moments with Al and with Jesus. We come away wanting to be a part of this faithful, loving family, and realize that in Jesus, we are.&#x201d;<br><br>Jayne V. Clark, MAR, Chief of Staff, Christian Counseling &amp; Educational Foundation<br><br>&#x201c;Al Groves was a mentor and friend to many people, and now his wife Libbie draws us into their private life with a mixture of intimacy, honesty, and practical theology. The result is simply inspiring. This whole book is &#x2018;vulnerably and excruciatingly beautiful,&#x2019; to borrow one of her own phrases, so get ready to weep, laugh, think, and reflect along with her.&#x201d;<br><br>Charles Clayton, Director, Oxford Leaders Ltd; Chief Executive, Primary Care Trauma Foundation; Former Executive Director of World Vision International<br><br>&#x201c;Libbie Groves invites us into her personal valley of death to help us see, hear, and feel how God comforts and strengthens his precious children. Instead of advising us how to avoid painful feelings, Libbie shows us how God walked her through the full range of human emotions that accompany the loss of a loved one in Christ. Our strong Savior disarms death, helps us face grief head-on with a sweet and certain hope of resurrection, and generously gives us himself in our deepest sorrow.&#x201d;<br><br>Barbara R. Duguid, Author of Extravagant Grace, Biblical Counselor, Speaker<br><br>&#x201c;Having followed and loved the blog Al and Libbie published during Al&#x2019;s illness, I wondered how any narrative could be as riveting. But in this book Libbie masterfully weaves the blog&#x2019;s inspiring messages into a story of love, courage, and humor. It is a model of how to walk the path of suffering while staying connected to God as the source of strength.&#x201d;<br><br>Amy Givler, MD, author of Hope in the Face of Cancer: A Survival Guide for the Journey You Did Not Choose<br><br>&#x201c;If you want to see the gospel in action, then retrace the steps of an ordinary family&#x2019;s bittersweet journey into the valley of the shadow of death. Bitter and tear-filled, for obvious reasons. Yet sweet and faith-filled, as they walk through the darkness, with eyes focused on the hope of resurrection and open to see the surprising ways God comforts them when facing the final enemy. Painful but profoundly encouraging!&#x201d;<br><br>Douglas Green, PhD, Professor of Old Testament, Westminster Theological Seminary<br><br>&#x201c;We struggle to give words to our experience of grief. In this book, Libbie has done a great service to all pilgrims who have laid another in the grave to await the resurrection from the dead. This is certainly a book to read slowly, prayerfully, and in conversation with others. It is deeply human and deeply heavenward at the same time. Read it and taste comingled grief and renewal. Just as the Psalms tell it and Al would have wanted it.&#x201d;<br><br>Michael Kelly, Professor of Old Testament, Westminster Theological Seminary.<br><br>&#x201c;Anyone facing this path of loss and uncertainty could benefit from the generous openness of a wise and loving friend whose confidence in the Lord&#x2019;s faithfulness and constant presence has been forged in similar circumstances. Here is such a friend.&#x201d;<br><br>Dr. Ruth Marshall, Biblical Counselling UK <br><br>&#x201c;In this memoir by Libbie Groves about her husband&#x2019;s death and her life beyond, she provides the reader many simple reminders of God&#x2019;s presence in dark times. However, the meditations from Al may have been my greatest delight. His observations about Psalm 22 and 23 alone are worth the price of the book. But read on, and see how God continues to meet Libbie in grief, joy, and most of all, the hope of heaven.&#x201d;<br><br>Philip G. Monroe, PsyD, Professor of Psychology &amp; Counseling, Biblical Seminary<br><br>&#x201c;In Grief Undone, Libby recounts her husband Al&#x2019;s battle with cancer and her subsequent journey as a widow and single mother. The book is an honest, encouraging read that doesn&#x2019;t minimize the heartache and agonizing pain of losing a loved one even as it testifies to the sustaining goodness of God and thehope of glory that lies ahead for Christians.&#x201d;<br><br>Erika Moore, Professor of Old Testament Studies and Hebrew.

Grief Undone is extraordinary!&#x201d; <br><br>Michael Phua, Rev, PhD, Associate Professor, Singapore Bible College<br><br>&#x201c;This book not only allows us to journey with Libbie, Al, and their kids through the valley of the shadow of death, it pointedly drives us to the hope of resurrection we have in Jesus Christ.

This exciting volume gathers theologians and historians who have thought through these critical and constructive issues: Do traditional understandings of the cross valorize suffering or violence? Are the older soteriological models, which see redemption as a kind of ransom or debt satisfaction, fitting for the contemporary worldview? Do they produce a piety that acquiesces in needless suffering, or does the cross precisely meet the massive suffering and injustice of today&#39;s world? Following an expert introduction to the issues and options by editor Marit Trelstad, each author addresses the Christian symbol of the cross in the context of current theological, sociological, political, or environmental issues.</p><p>Marit A.

His follow up, Spic&#x2013;O&#x2013;Rama (1993), a "dysfunctional family comedy," presents 24&#x2013;hours in the life of one family. It enjoyed a sold&#x2013;out run in Chicago before relocating to New York where it won its creator a Drama Desk Award. Freak (1998), Leguizamo's Broadway debut, is his own coming&#x2013;of&#x2013;age story. A "demi&#x2013;semi&#x2013;quasi&#x2013;pseudo&#x2013;autobiography," the show was a critical and commercial success and won an Emmy when it was shown on TV. Sexaholix: A Love Story (2001), based on the sold&#x2013;out national tour of John Leguizamo Live! was nominated for an Outer Critics Circle Award as well as a Tony Award. </p><p> Alternately hilarious and poignant, always candid and searingly intelligent, The Works of John Leguizamo is a must&#x2013;have for fans of this inimitable performer.</p></p><p><p>John Leguizamo was born in Colombia in 1964 and immigrated to Queens, New York, with his family when he was four years old. He began his career as a stand-up comedian in various New York clubs, and has gone on to critically acclaimed performances on film, television, and Broadway. He lives in New York City.</p></p><h2>Signature Sins: Taming Our Wayward Hearts</h2><p>Finally--a safe place to talk about sin. The topic of sin <em>in general</em> has been safe for a while. But here, guided by psychologist Michael Mangis, we get specific by learning to know ourselves and our signature sins--the individual and specific patterns of sin in our life that affect our thoughts, actions and relationships. In these pages, the author empathetically and honestly reflects on the ways we manage our behavior to hide our sin and ignore the true poverty of our hearts. But until we deal with the root of our sin, we will be ruled and fooled by it, and miss the freedom Christ died to bring. Exploring common forms of sin and then discovering how our own temperament, culture, family and gender affect the way those sins manifest themselves in our lives will lead us to a place of real honesty with ourselves, God and others. But the book doesn't stop there; it also shows ways to combat our sin so that we can change our <em>hearts,</em> not just our behavior. Sin is serious and specific, and it doesn't go away on its own. But here is serious--and safe--help for facing sin and finding freedom in Christ.</p><p>Michael Mangis is a professor of psychology at Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois. He is also a practicing psychologist and cofounder of the Center for Rural Psychology in Elburn, Illinois. His research interests include integration of psychology and theology as well as rural psychology. <em>Signature Sins</em> is his first InterVarsity Press title.A wonderful example of <em>practical</em> integration and a very helpful book for lay audiences. (Brad D. Strawn, Journal of Spiritual Formation &amp; Soul Care, Fall 2009)<br><br>This is not intended as a scholarly work, but as an engaging challenge to all Christians to do one of the more important things we are supposed to do: examine our consciences and hold ourselves and one another accountable for the faith that is in us. This the author does well. His impressive book is warmly recommended. (Daniel Muth, The Living Church, March 22, 2009)<br><br>Each chapter ends with helpful questions to facilitate one's own spiritual journey, and the book ends with additional chapters a small group could use. This makes this resource particularly helpful and practical. An important contribution to the literature on spiritual formation and Christian integration. A helpful reminder of the state and condition of sin that extends into all facets of human experience (Mark Yarhouse, Limning the Psyche, (psychologyandchristianity.wordpress.com), October 12, 2008)<br><br>Rich in serious (but not solemn) insight and advice. (Library Journal, October 1, 2008)<br><br>Rich in serious (but not solemn) insight and advice. (Library Journal, October 2008)<br><br>"Michael Mangis's book offers more than just diagnosis of our signature sins--it offers help and hope in the areas where we need it most. Of particular value is Mangis's thoughtful integration of psychology and spirituality as it relates to the subject of sin--something that is much-needed!" (Ruth Haley Barton, cofounder and president, Transforming Center, and author of Strengthening the Soul of Your Leadership)<br><br>"Mangis says he wants to induce excitement on our Christian journey, not guilt or gloom. That is difficult to do in a book about sin, but he succeeds by helping us to recognize that sin is far more complex and grace is far more dynamic than we might have thought. By constantly reminding us that one size doesn't fit all, Mangis draws on Scripture and the Christian tradition, anecdotes from his own life and his practice as a psychotherapist, and a reservoir of helpful analogies to engage readers in an eminently practical and thoughtful examination of their own spiritual health with prescriptive suggestions for hearts that are prone to wander. What I found encouraging was his ability to integrate insights from the field of psychology with an honesty and humility that refrains from making Christianity obsequious to the social sciences." (Dennis Okholm, professor of theology, Azusa Pacific University and author of Monk Habits for Everyday People)<br><br>"I often hear people distinguish between wisdom and knowledge. Michael W. Mangis brings the two together--in his personal life, in his teaching and now in this remarkable book, <em>Signature Sins.</em> Read this book. It is deeply informative, spiritually inspiring, written with clarity, filled with practical questions for self-reflection and saturated with an awareness of God's grace." (Mark R. McMinn, professor of psychology, George Fox University, and author of Sin and Grace in Christian Counseling)<br><br>"Michael Mangis has provided an excellent resource for soul-care professionals and laity. <em>Signature Sins</em> is honest, comprehensive and accessible. Few writers could offer the blending of psychological scholarship and theological sophistication in a style that is warm and approachable." (Gary W. Moon, executive editor, Conversations and author of Falling for God)<br><br>"Mangis is a subtle prophet-sage, confronting our sin while gently steering us between the shoals of legalistic sin management and psychological excuse making. His book is marked by beautiful contrasts: deep but simple; ancient but fresh; it is good integration that takes the Bible seriously. The author accomplishes a lot in a small space, combining practical spiritual direction with the insights of a Christian dynamic therapy. This will be useful for laypersons and pastors, counselors and their counselees, directors and their friends." (Eric L. Johnson, director, Society for Christian Psychology and author of Foundations for Soul Care)</p><h2>This is Our Story</h2><p>No one knows what happened that morning at River Point. Five boys went hunting. Four came back. The boys won't say who fired the shot that killed their friend, Grant; the evidence shows it could have been any one of them. <br>Kate Marino's senior year internship at the District Attorney's Office isn't exactly glamorous-more like an excuse to leave school early that looks good on college applications. Then the DA hands her boss, Mr. Stone, the biggest case her small town of Belle Terre has ever seen. The River Point Boys are all anyone can talk about. Despite their damning toxicology reports the morning of the accident, the DA wants the boys' case swept under the rug. He owes his political office to their powerful families.<br>Kate won't let that happen. Digging up secrets without revealing her own is a dangerous line to walk; Kate has personal reasons for seeking justice for Grant. As she investigates with Stone-the aging prosecutor relying on Kate to see and hear what he cannot-she realizes that nothing about the case-or the boys-is what it seems. Grant wasn't who she thought he was, and neither is Stone's prime suspect. As Kate gets dangerously close to the truth, it becomes clear that the early morning accident might not have been an accident at all-and if Kate doesn't uncover the true killer, more than one life could be on the line?including her own. <br><br></p><p><b>Ashley Elston</b> is the daughter of an attorney and grew up surrounded by talk of court cases, crazy clients, and the law in general ? all of which triggered the ideas in her legal thrillers.

Mama said this was all hogwash. Firstly, there was no such thing as giants. Wouldn&#x2019;t we see such large creatures if they really existed? And secondly, we had no relation to any duke--if we did, we&#x2019;d be rich and living on a grand estate. Instead, we were poor as dirt and lived in a tiny house on a small farm in a little village. Nothing great or giant about it.<br><br>But Papa wasn&#x2019;t concerned with the details. He believed there was greatness in that name, and if he gave it to me, somehow the greatness would sink into my bones.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll name him Jack,&#x201d; Papa said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be great.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you say so,&#x201d; said Mama. She was a practical woman and not particular with names. All she needed was a word to call me to supper, or deliver a scolding. I got my first scolding before my first supper, just after birth, for as soon as Papa pronounced my name, I sprang a sharp tooth, and bit my mother.<br><br>&#x201c;Ouch!&#x201d; Mama cried. &#x201c;You naughty boy!&#x201d; It was something she would call me more often than Jack.<br><br>Papa had the nerve to laugh. &#x201c;Oh, Alice, he&#x2019;s just a baby. He doesn&#x2019;t know any better.&#x201d;<br><br>But Mama believed I did know better. To her, that bite was a little omen of what was to come, like a sprinkle before the downpour, a buzz before the sting, or the onset of an itch before you realize you&#x2019;re covered in poison ivy.<br><br>Maybe I was born to be great, but great at what?<br><br>At five months old, I learned to crawl. I was fast as a cockroach, Papa said. One minute I was by Mama&#x2019;s skirts, and the next I was in the pigsty, rolling around in the muck and slops. Mama said she had to bathe me twice a day just to keep me from turning into a real pig.<br><br>I learned to walk before my first year, and by my second I took to climbing. I climbed chairs and tables, the woodpile, trees. Once Mama found me on the roof, and snatched me up before I slid down the chimney into a blazing fire.<br><br>&#x201c;Such a naughty boy,&#x201d; said Mama.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s just a boy,&#x201d; said Papa.<br><br>But I didn&#x2019;t want to be &#x201c;just a boy.&#x201d; I wanted to be great. <br><br>At night, Papa would tell stories of Grandpa Jack: how he&#x2019;d chop off giants&#x2019; heads and steal all their treasure and rescue the innocents. I knew if I was going to be great, I&#x2019;d have to go on a noble quest and conquer a giant--or nine--just like my seven-greats-grandpa Jack. <br><br>There was only one problem. I&#x2019;d never seen a giant in all my twelve years.<br>&#x201c;Stop staring at the sky, Jack,&#x201d; said Papa. &#x201c;The work&#x2019;s down here.&#x201d;<br><br>It was harvesttime, same as every year. Work, work, work. Boring, boring, boring. And after the work was done, we were still poor as dirt.<br><br>Papa whistled a merry tune as he cut the wheat. I grumbled as I gathered it up in a bundle and tied it around the middle. We did this over and over, until we&#x2019;d made a pile as tall as Papa. I thought we&#x2019;d be nearly done, but when I looked up, I saw acres of uncut wheat. &#x201c;Snakes and toads.&#x201d; I grumbled. How I hated the sight.<br><br>&#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t she the prettiest sight you ever saw?&#x201d; Papa called the land she, like a lady he was trying to woo. Most of the time it seemed like the land just spat in Papa&#x2019;s face, but he was ever faithful. Papa loved the land.<br><br>Me? I could live without it. I preferred a sword to a scythe, and a noble steed to a cow. I&#x2019;d go on a quest to fight giants and get gold and riches. Then I&#x2019;d never have to milk another cow or harvest a crop on a hot day.<br><br>I looked toward the house, where Mama was hanging the wash on the line. Annabella was flitting around her like a butterfly, her braids bouncing on her shoulders, not a care in the world, until . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Eeeeaak!&#x201d; Annabella screamed, and frantically shook her apron. A fat grasshopper flew out and disappeared into the tall grass.<br><br>I stifled a laugh. Annabella is my sister, four years younger. I guess when I hit three or so, Mama decided I was a lost cause and tried again, taking every precaution to do things differently. So firstly, she had a girl, and secondly, she didn&#x2019;t allow Papa to name her or make any declarations of greatness. She was Mama&#x2019;s sweet girl.<br><br>I remember seeing Annabella for the first time after she was born, all pink and bald and toothless. Mama cooed at her like she&#x2019;d finally gotten what she always wanted. A boring lump that didn&#x2019;t bite or even move.<br><br>&#x201c;Back to work, Jack,&#x201d; said Papa.<br><br>I sighed. Papa cut and I gathered and tied. Work, work, work. Boring, boring, boring. I considered feigning illness so I could take a break.<br><br>But what luck! Someone else disrupted the work for me. Mama was walking toward us now. Annabella bounced at her side, and on the other side was our nearest neighbor, but certainly not our dearest friend, Miss Lettie Nettle.<br><br>She looked none too pleased at this moment. Her eyebrows were pushed together, and the folds around her mouth hung down around her chin like one of those sad-faced hounds, only she was an angry hound. She glared right at me. Mama anxiously twisted her apron in her hands.<br><br>I scratched my head and scoured my brain. Had I pulled any pranks on Miss Lettie lately? I didn&#x2019;t think so. . . .</p><h2>Strega</h2><p>Andrew Vachss's implacable private eye has a new client, Strega.

At first meeting, the new shepherd made a mild impression, fine-boned with smooth skin, spectacles, and a bald head. By surface appearances, he was a timid man, but his quick, sharp eyes and the fire of his sermons revealed that he was not. His greatest gifts were the content of his sermons and the strength of his presence in the pulpit. His own soul knew the bitter taste of daily trials, and so he was a genuine witness in his mission to frail humanity. His was a constant litany, crying out about the perfect soul-gathering rescue of Jesus Christ and the joys to be found in him.<br><br>Reverend Kelley could speak directly to the souls of these Georgia people. His heritage was close to that of his congregants. The Kelley family origins were proud, Irish, and Southern. From Virginia in the 1750s, the Kelleys found their way into Georgia, to Franklin County and the small hill town of Toccoa. Theirs was the rugged earth of north Georgia hill country, a land of Cherokee people and hardscrabble settlement. A century later, the region became a favorite highway for the mean ruin of Union forces during the Atlanta campaign. Two young witnesses to the Civil War, Mary Emily Payne and Emory Jackson Kelley, later married and raised nine children surrounded by the deprivations of Reconstruction. Ernest David, born in 1883, was called to ministry in 1911. Ordained through the Broad River Baptist Church, Reverend Kelley chose to serve the common man on the sawdust trail. He met and married Clora Casey of Cedartown, eleven years his junior, and his first son, Casey, was born in 1917. Jackson DeForest came along in 1920. In 1925, Reverend Kelley earned a graduate degree in theology from Mercer University. He served churches with names like Zebulon, Attica, County Line, and Penfield. With Clora at his side, he ministered all over the interior of Georgia.<br><br>Now at the height of his physical and spiritual strength, Reverend Kelley shared the gospel in Conyers. Educated and poor, after nearly fifteen years of preaching, the Reverend knew the hearts and minds of men and the dangers of a worldly life. His call for unswerving Christian faith was mixed with Christian warning: he made it very clear to his congregation and to his children that there were grave consequences for sinful yet ordinary behaviors such as going to dances and movies and drinking and smoking. The saved and those yet to be salvaged were invited to find and renew their spirit in a Baptist way of life with the Kelleys. While the Reverend ministered with his sermons and mastery of the Bible, his wife ministered by loving example and gentle touch.<br><br>Reverend Kelley kept his boys, Ernest Casey and Jackson DeForest, close to the church. He made them learn the responsibilities of the elect; the boys knew they were representing something far larger than their own small lives. The mission of the father was the mission of the family. As a preacher's kid, DeForest was bound to the sawdust trail of his father's ministry. Athens, Woodville, and so on, they moved from one Georgia mill town to the next. Reverend Kelley shaped his sons with an eye on the promise of heaven and the literal existence of hell. He ruled with the steady hand of the righteous, while Clora worked to soften that hand with humor and diplomacy. However, the traditional round of Bible study, quotation and recitation, psalms at supper, Wednesday evening prayer meetings, and Sundays filled with classes and multiple services challenged the obedience of even the most respectful child. DeForest's brother, Casey, chafed under the restrictions of the household and seemed quite unable to please anyone completely. He was already a teenager, vexed by many things his little brother couldn't begin to imagine. DeForest, like his mother, sought to keep the peace. DeForest's first role was his portrayal of the Good Son.<br><br>Sometimes DeForest spent long hours playing outside, and when it was time, from deep in the shadows of the porch, Clora would call out, "DeForest!...DeForest!" and the boy's name rang out all around the big house and yard. DeForest loved that sound of his mother's calling. Other times, the little boy stayed close to his mother to keep her company as she worked. While she did her chores, his eyes were often drawn to her only finery, an ice-bright diamond ring. Clora wore it always, while washing, ironing, and scrubbing, "and it was all smooth...and the prongs wore down slowly," the boy remembered. She cherished that ring, and so did her son. Her brother, the mysterious Herman Casey, won the ring in a card game in France and gave it to her. Her boy DeForest wanted to give her something, too; he wanted to give her the world. As young as he was, he knew her life was hard, and he wished to make it easier for her somehow, and so he became her sunshine.<br><br>DeForest was immersed in the Reverend's mission in Conyers. There his sermons were thundering appeals delivered in lightning. He called all to a worldly mission to "seek and save the lost." To join him, one must be filled with the Holy Spirit, and for that to happen, one must surrender. "Are you willing to crucify self?" the Reverend challenged every member. He promised them that failure would mean "wreck and ruin."<br><br>Ten-year-old DeForest began to think that there could be only hellfire and damnation for someone as weak and selfish as he knew himself to be, and his father gave no indication otherwise. DeForest worked ever harder at being the good son. With some resignation, he recalled, "It was a hard row to hoe, to be perfect."<br><br><b>2</b> Before their first year in Conyers was over, Reverend Kelley introduced the congregation to DeForest's musical talents. In the words of Erskine Davis, DeForest's friend during those years, the boy had a "very good voice for singing. He often sang a solo at the morning church service. Two of his favorites were 'Living for Jesus' and 'Jesus Is All the World to Me.' While DeForest sang, Reverend Kelley would beam with pride and joy. Sometimes he would stand by DeForest while he sang." The Reverend made good use of DeForest's gifts and seemed determined to forge the boy into an instrument of ministry. For the holidays, the Reverend presented a Christmas exercise. DeForest received "a great hand, the solo work of this 10-year-old boy being especially good," according to the local paper. DeForest's uncle, Dr. Luther H. Kelley, "slipped in and took a back seat just like most doctors do at church and grand opera."<br><br>DeForest's performances, his manners, and his charm made him popular in Conyers. He was a sensitive boy who appreciated neatness, process, and order; messes and contrariness disturbed him. Contrariness, indeed! One grandmother drove DeForest to distraction by insisting on calling him Forrest, as in Nathan Bedford Forrest, the Civil War hero. When he tended to her, she would look at whatever he might bring her and say, "Set it down here, Forrest." And he'd put her tray down. Finally, he brought her a gift and told her if she would say his name right, he would give her his gift. Smiling, she agreed. He gave it to her; she admired it and handed it back to him: "Set it down here, Forrest." Everyone knew, and she did, too, that he was named for Lee DeForest, the genius of the new century who made the radio possible, as well as talking movies and all kinds of things. Dr. DeForest traveled the country, promoting his work and inspiring the common man to look forward to the new world just taking shape in the early twentieth century. Reverend Kelley was very impressed with the mind and inventions of Dr. DeForest, and his second son was given a name fit for the future.<br><br>But the present times were hard. To help out, DeForest hunted squirrel, rabbit, and possum -- anything that might fill the family table -- but he had no taste for killing and never hunted unless he had to. Reverend Kelley took on a second church, the Rockdale Baptist Church a few miles west of town, for the small sum that congregation could offer. While the Reverend preached, DeForest hunted and sometimes hosed down the coal laborers at the Conyers rail depot for a coin or two, but these small amounts could not do much to relieve the Kelleys' ministerial poverty. There was no shame in their lack, and it was no sin to do without.<br><br>In Conyers, one of DeForest's favorite playmates was the small son of Emma Banks, who did some day work for Clora Kelley. Emma's house was little more than a shack in West Conyers, but her yard was interesting, with an outdoor laundry kettle, chickens, and a woodpile where DeForest and sometimes his brother Casey would go to play and be with Emma. She made a deep impression on DeForest, and he took her into his heart.<br><br>DeForest took pleasure in his life in Conyers, trapping rabbits, fishing, wading in the water to catch tadpoles and bugs. He loved Sandy Kelley, the little brown dog that kept close tabs on the young master, waiting for him while DeForest was in school. Toward the end of every school day, DeForest would go near the classroom's open window and sharpen his pencil, signaling Sandy that dismissal time approached. He remembered, "That little dog's tail would raise up, and off he'd go, down the street, through the window without the screen, and all around the house; then he'd come back and lead me home."<br><br>School lunches could be dreary, but Erskine Davis's mother baked a yeast loaf for his sandwiches. Erskine's father was a dairy farmer and grew wheat for the family bread, taking it to the local mill to be ground. The smell and taste of the bread were just wonderful. "DeForest would come around at lunch recess and swap two of his sandwiches for one of mine," Davis remembers. A boy who knew quality had to be willing to pay up for it, and DeForest was such a boy.<br><br>DeForest's elementary-school teacher, Mary J. Cowan, gave him stellar reports for neatness, promptness, attendance, and conduct. He did very well in agriculture, grammar, geography, and reading. He earned B's in physiology, history, spelling, and writing. Arithmetic never meant very much, though he did fairly well. In 1932, he was advanced into high school.<br><br>It was easier to express high spirits among the children, teachers, and staff at school than in the company of Reverend Kelley. And DeForest's angelic sweetness had a good touch of Tom Sawyer salt in it. It seems he was just the boy for the role of Tom, in something he vaguely recalled later as "Tom Sawyer Paints a Fence," apparently his first experience onstage. He enjoyed cutting up for his classmates; Tom Doyle especially appreciated young Kelley's efforts. The principal of Conyers High School was a tall, stern man with a bald head, rather like the Reverend Kelley. Doyle recalls that the principal would, whenever he passed their classroom, go up on tiptoes to peer at them through the window at the top of the door. When he did that, DeForest would croon, "The moon is rising! The moo-ooon is risiiing!" Muffling the laughter would be half the battle, stifling admiration for DeForest's nerve the other half.ar<br><br>One of DeForest's favorite classes was Miss Bedenbaugh's French class. She was "a tiny, pretty, dark-haired lady," Doyle recalls. "Each French class, DeForest would tell her, 'My, you look pretty today!'" All sugar and snowball, DeForest flummoxed her with charm. He didn't let up. She was so dazzled, "we didn't learn a lot of French," Doyle admits.<br><br>DeForest and Tom were far outnumbered by the girls at school. The boys soon realized their sublime situation. Often, they hid in the cloakroom for a kiss or two or three, with one or two or three of the girls. Estelle was an especially pretty girl, and one day she got a pass to go to the library. DeForest and Tom decided to go, too, and all three headed arm-in-arm to the library in the basement. In the stairwell, Tom and DeForest each gave Estelle a big smooch, and just then they looked up and saw the principal at the top of the stairs. The boys dropped their books and ran for it, Tom crying out, "Excuse me, Professor!" All three skedaddled back to the classroom.<br><br>After school, there were hours of precious freedom. I. G. Ellis's dad was the manager of the Coca-Cola plant just across the street from the Baptist church. Often after school, three pals -- Tom, DeForest, and Flip Cook, the sheriff's son whom DeForest christened "Flip Flop Floyd the Flea" -- would go with I.G. to visit his dad at the plant, "and he would give us a free ice-cold Coke...a big treat."<br><br>Toward dusk, it was time to see Tom to the depot for his ride home on the Dinky. Tom's father ran the quarter-sized locomotive from Milstead to Conyers for the Callaway Mill; his last run was at the end of the day, and Tom had better be on it or walk miles to get home. Often the boys would hear that whistle blow, and DeForest and friends would holler, "The Dinky's waiting for you! The Dinky is singin'!" and they would race to the depot.<br><br>Sometimes there would be a sleepover. Tom, DeForest, and Flip looked for adventure on those nights. One Saturday, the musketeers slept over at Flip's. The Cook family lived downstairs in the jail, with prison cells above. The cells were generally used only for drunks on Saturday nights. "After everyone was asleep, we went upstairs. We took an empty Prince Albert Pipe Tobacco can and raked it across the prison cell bars, waking the drunks and tormenting them!" Doyle says. The sheriff finally woke up and put an end to it, and they got an earful from prisoners and sheriff alike.<br><br>DeForest treasured his memories of schooldays and friends in Conyers. Other idyllic memories came from travels during summer break. The Kelleys would make their way back to Toccoa to enjoy the family reunions. DeForest met up with his cousins and many aunts and uncles. "Tons of good food and watermelons later taken from the cool water," he recalled. The boy was especially close to his dear Aunt Gladys, a loving, centralizing force in the Kelley clan. And DeForest was very proud of his uncle Dr. Luther Kelley, a highly respected surgeon and veteran, who brought DeForest into the world with his own hands. Luther was the most successful and respected of the Kelley clan.<br><br>To follow in the footsteps of his uncle would have been a great and noble thing, but the Great Depression meant that higher education was already out of the question for Casey and DeForest. DeForest had all the usual youngster's aspirations of the day, such as being an aviator or a cowboy. He wanted to be a cowboy more than anything. He dreamed all kinds of big dreams, but there was no money and no sign that things would ever change in the Kelley household. His father and mother strongly impressed upon their sons that expectations must be held in check. Humility and spiritual rewards were paramount. Their teachings may have been the kindest lessons they could impart, for the 1930s were not conducive to lofty goals such as higher education or the arts.<br><br><b>3</b> DeForest looked forward to seasonal events, family reunions, and the traveling wonders that came and went. He particularly enjoyed the evangeli...</p><h2>The Way to Heaven: The Gospel According to John Wesley</h2><p><p>Is There a Way to Heaven?

In <i>All Fishermen Are Liars, </i>Gierach travels around North America seeking out quintessential fishing experiences, whether it&#x2019;s at a busy stream or a secluded lake hidden amid snow-capped mountains. He talks about the art of fly-tying and the quest for the perfect steelhead fly (&#x201c;The Nuclear Option&#x201d;), about fishing in the Presidential Pools previously fished by the elder George Bush (&#x201c;I wondered briefly if I&#x2019;d done something karmically disastrous and was now fated to spend the rest of my life breathing the exhaust of this elderly Republican&#x201d;), and the importance of traveling with like-minded companions when caught in a soaking rain (&#x201c;At this point someone is required to say, &#x2018;You know, there are people who wouldn&#x2019;t think this is fun&#x2019;&#x201d;).

He lives in Lyons, Colorado.&nbsp;All Fishermen Are Liars <br> <br><br><br>1<br> <br>A DAY AT THE OFFICE<br> <br>Chances are you&#x2019;re raised in the country or in a small town surrounded by country: someplace where you can easily walk or ride your bike to the edge of what until recently had been the known world, and then on into the fields, woods and creeks beyond. Some of this is private land and you occasionally have to crawl through a barbed-wire fence to get on it, but the niceties of ownership are left to the adults to sort out. To a kid, it&#x2019;s all just unpopulated and there to explore. The first time a farmer yells at you for trespassing, you honestly don&#x2019;t know what he&#x2019;s talking about.<br> <br>You&#x2019;re equipped for this wilderness with a hand-me-down folding knife and the Army-issue compass your father brought home from World War Two. The weight of these items in your pocket feels comfortingly substantial; although you understand only in a theoretical way that the compass is some sort of insurance against getting lost. You haven&#x2019;t yet learned the hard lesson that it doesn&#x2019;t matter where north is if you don&#x2019;t know which direction you came from.<br> <br>In addition to the knife and compass, you have a cane fishing pole with a line stout enough to land a tarpon, as well as a slingshot that seems potentially lethal but maddeningly inaccurate. You also have a crude homemade spear that you keep hidden because you know Dad will ask what you plan to do with it and you won&#x2019;t have an acceptable answer. Taken together, these items constitute the beginning of a lifelong fascination with the tools of sport.<br> <br>You experience the kind of freedom that will be unknown to future generations. This is the 1950s, when kids are still allowed to run wild as long as they&#x2019;re home by dark. It&#x2019;s also a time when low-grade delinquency&#x2014;like trespassing, truancy or the odd fistfight&#x2014;comes under the heading of &#x201c;boys will be boys.&#x201d; You might get scolded or spanked, but you won&#x2019;t have to undergo counseling.<br> <br>Like all children, you take your play as seriously as any young predator. The only difference you see when you begin to tag along with the grown-ups on actual hunting and fishing trips is that their toys are larger, heavier and in some cases louder than yours. At first you&#x2019;re there as a mascot, unable to keep up and making too much noise, but eventually you see that this is serious adult business and prove yourself enough to trade the slingshot for a .22 rifle and graduate to a rod with a reel on it.<br> <br>Dad begins to sense an opportunity. When the time comes for you to have your own shotgun, he gives you the Fox Sterlingworth 12-gauge he got from your grandfather. (It&#x2019;s a little more gun than you can handle, but you&#x2019;ll grow into it.) Then he acts surprised to find that he no longer has a shotgun and says he guesses he&#x2019;ll just have to buy himself a new one. It turns out to be the sexy Italian double he&#x2019;s been mooning over for years. The same thing happens with other gear until, by your late teens, Dad has all new stuff and your room looks like a used sporting goods store.<br> <br>Hunting and fishing are the two things you and your father can always talk about easily, but over time other subjects become quagmires. There&#x2019;s the competition over the family sedan that comes with the first driver&#x2019;s license; the first serious awareness of politics spurred by the civil rights movement and the assassination of President Kennedy; books that weren&#x2019;t assigned at school and that some of your teachers disapprove of; loud rock and roll and a certain dark-haired girl with big, soft eyes. In hindsight, you think you must have been confused, but at the time, you seem pretty damned sure of yourself.<br> <br>By the time you head off to college, you&#x2019;ve begun to drift away from sport and are now trying to picture yourself as a poet and intellectual. On the other hand, you bring along your .22 and take the occasional break in season for some rabbit hunting. You now understand what trespassing is, and this time when the farmer yells at you, you explain that you&#x2019;re a struggling college student just trying to get a cottontail for dinner, exaggerating the poverty angle a little, but not exactly lying. He takes in the long hair and the attempt at a beard. Then he says, &#x201c;Next time, stop by the house first.&#x201d;<br> <br>You&#x2019;ve also brought a rod and there&#x2019;s a slow, brown river flowing through town, but you&#x2019;ve never seen anyone fishing it and can&#x2019;t imagine anything living in water with that peculiar industrial aroma. It&#x2019;s only years later that you wonder what you&#x2019;d have found if you&#x2019;d followed the thing upstream, past the outflow from the brewery and on into farm country. But at the time, you&#x2019;re too busy with books, lectures, political demonstrations, music, beer, early struggles with writing and another girl with big eyes. She&#x2019;s your third. Or maybe fourth.<br> <br>After graduation you&#x2019;re offered a job in the bar you&#x2019;ve been drinking in for the last four years. You suspect this is an act of charity. Your major was philosophy, which the bar owner has described as &#x201c;a quaint but useless discipline.&#x201d; With your bachelor&#x2019;s degree in hand and no plans for graduate school, you begin to see his point.<br> <br>This tavern has seemed more like home than your various apartments and trailers, but you&#x2019;re envisioning a bigger change than switching from one side of the bar to the other. You&#x2019;re unemployed if not actually unemployable and have no other prospects, so you drive out to the Rocky Mountains to look around.<br> <br>In Colorado, in a town at an elevation of 10,000 feet with five year-round residents (how did you end up here?), you go to work in a silver mine for room, board and shares. You&#x2019;re living in a cabin on the mine property with two other young guys at loose ends: an out-of-work actor and a sullen revolutionary type who reveals nothing whatsoever about his past, including his last name. It&#x2019;s possible that he just values his privacy, but you suspect he&#x2019;s on the lam.<br> <br>The room is okay, but the board is on the thin side, tending toward beans and tortillas, so you rediscover fishing, this time for trout. They seem small&#x2014;on the order of bluegills&#x2014;but they&#x2019;re the loveliest fish you&#x2019;ve ever seen and they live in country where both the scenery and the altitude take your breath away&#x2014;one figuratively, the other literally.<br> <br>You don&#x2019;t have much money, but you buy a fly rod and later a rifle for mule deer. You had a deer rifle of sorts when you came west, but somewhere along the line you traded it for a used fuel pump and a tank of gas. It was a surplus .303 Enfield. No great loss.<br> <br>The Second World War has been over for twenty-five years now, but the used equipment is still readily available and cheap, so it constitutes most of your outdoor gear: clothing, packs, pup tents, sleeping bags, tarps, sheath knives, canteens, mess kits, Dad&#x2019;s old compass and so on. If our troops in that conflict had been issued fly rods, you&#x2019;d have one of those, too.<br> <br>In the end, the shares in the mine you&#x2019;ve been counting on don&#x2019;t pan out. It turns out that the owner sold several hundred percent of the thing to gullible investors and it&#x2019;s largely worthless anyway. Eventually the authorities get involved.<br> <br>But no one comes to evict you from the cabin and you realize you could squat there indefinitely. It&#x2019;s tempting. There&#x2019;s firewood to cut, water to haul, fish and game in the surrounding mountains and some blue-collar fun to be had in a tavern twenty miles down a dirt road. On the other hand, you&#x2019;re broke, there&#x2019;s no work and you&#x2019;d freeze over the winter, so you and your partners drift off in different directions. You never see either of them again.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a side trip to New York City, where you stay with a girlfriend from college, work a low-paying job and try to be a writer. None of it works out and one day you inadvertently panhandle a friend from college. You don&#x2019;t recognize him at first because he&#x2019;s wearing a sport coat and has cut his hair short. He buys you lunch and slips you a twenty. You&#x2019;re embarrassed, but you eat the cheeseburger and take the money.<br> <br>Not long after that you go back to Colorado. You tell yourself you weren&#x2019;t defeated by the city, it&#x2019;s just that you couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking about mountains and rivers and brightly colored trout swimming in cold, clean water.<br> <br>You find a cheap place to live, trade your car for a seriously used four-wheel-drive and register it in Colorado so you can buy resident fishing and hunting licenses. You begin a series of manual-labor jobs to get by. You&#x2019;re young and strong and a good worker, but your mind habitually wanders to the fishing and writing you now do in every minute of your time off. One day a boss catches you daydreaming and says, &#x201c;You know, another hump like you comes down the pike every day.&#x201d; You reply, &#x201c;Yeah, and there&#x2019;s another shitty job like this one around every corner.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s becoming clear that you don&#x2019;t have a future in the diplomatic service. In fact, you&#x2019;re not at all sure what you have in mind for yourself, but it&#x2019;s beginning to look like it might involve a typewriter instead of a shovel.<br> <br>You marry one of the girls with big, dark eyes, but it doesn&#x2019;t last. When the justice of the peace who tied the knot asked if you&#x2019;d thought this through, you said, &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; but in fact you hadn&#x2019;t. The divorce is painless. She doesn&#x2019;t want the books, the rifle or the fly rod. You have no use for the herbal tea, the tarot cards or the teepee.<br> <br>Other women in your life also work out temporarily, but eventually they all begin to give you a certain quizzical look that you come to recognize. They&#x2019;re asking themselves, &#x201c;What was I thinking?&#x201d;<br> <br>You continue to try things on for size: jobs, friends, ideas, writing styles, outdoor sports, various controlled substances that are available at the time and a wide range of wild country in all seasons. You realize that you can&#x2019;t write what you know when you don&#x2019;t know anything, so you travel compulsively and try everything. You make some mistakes, but none of them are fatal, although you do injure a knee, frostbite some toes and bugger an elbow, and none of them are ever quite the same again.<br> <br>In a college town you meet some writers and some fly fishers and settle in to learn the respective crafts. You&#x2019;ve been writing since high school and fishing since before you can remember, but it turns out you know less about either than you thought you did. On the other hand, you&#x2019;re not entirely surprised to find that success in both disciplines depends on patience, persistence, diligence and attention to detail. These were never your strong points, but you vow to change.<br> <br>You publish here and there in literary magazines for bragging rights, but no money. You even get a thin volume of poems into print, but come to see that poetry is unlikely to dollar up, as they say out West. As someone once said, &#x201c;A publisher would rather see a burglar in his office than a poet.&#x201d;<br> <br>You also manage to catch some trout.<br> <br>In the grand scheme of things, these are not enormous accomplishments, but they make you inordinately happy. Decades later you review your Social Security earnings record and find that several of those years are commemorated by columns of zeros. You wonder how you managed to keep body and soul together. Apparently you were destitute, but that&#x2019;s not how you remember it.<br> <br>You live in an odd succession of houses and apartments with an equally odd succession of people: students, former students, would-be students, struggling writers, painters, musicians, craftsmen and others who defy categorization. You attend periodic house meetings to determine the identity of the people on the floor in sleeping bags. If no one who&#x2019;s paying rent knows them, they&#x2019;re asked to leave.<br> <br>You&#x2019;re neither a great writer nor a great fisherman, but these continue to be the two things you care about most and it&#x2019;s a surprisingly long time before it occurs to you to put the two together. Finally you write a story about fly fishing and sell it to a magazine for the equivalent of a month&#x2019;s wages. This is the first time you&#x2019;ve been paid actual money for something you&#x2019;ve written. The now-comfortable role of starving artist notwithstanding, it feels pretty damned good.<br> <br>You begin to freelance for fishing magazines, go to work as the outdoor columnist for a daily newspaper and publish a book that does well enough for the publisher to ask if you have another one in the works. It just so happens that you do. It&#x2019;s a gradual start, but when fly fishing begins to get fashionable, you&#x2019;re already in place: maybe not a top gun, but a somewhat established writer just the same. This is the equivalent of pulling off at a random turnout along an unknown river, stumbling into the cosmic green drake hatch and having the right fly.<br> <br>The books, the magazines and the newspaper don&#x2019;t pay all that well individually, but taken together they sometimes add up to enough. It happens slowly, with several false starts, but finally you quit the last of an interminable series of part-time jobs and begin making a living as a writer.<br> <br>This leads to occasional misunderstandings. Some people assume that you&#x2019;re now rich because the only other writer they know anything about is Ernest Hemingway. These include some who should know better, like the guy who writes in the London Times that your populist persona is just an act and that you&#x2019;re actually an eccentric millionaire. What? Luckily, none of your friends read the London Times, but they do read the magazine that names you &#x201c;angler of the year.&#x201d; You&#x2019;re delighted, but the ribbing is unmerciful, beginning with the friend who asks, &#x201c;So, have those guys ever fished with you?&#x201d;<br> <br>You meet a man who, in the course of a durable friendship, teaches you most of what you&#x2019;ll ever know about fly fishing and incidentally helps you dial yourself back in the direction of the native midwesterner you&#x2019;d always been. He&#x2019;s also what you&#x2019;d call &#x201c;colorful,&#x201d; so you naturally write about him and early on people ask if he&#x2019;s real, or just a fictional character. Years later, when he goes on the road as a public speaker and you become somewhat reclusive, people ask him the same thing about you.<br> <br>You buy a small, mediocre house near a small, mediocre trout stream, and after a few good years you manage to pay off the mortgage. This leaves you nearly broke, but you own your home outright, which is crucial for a writer&#x2014;a profession in which the regular paychecks needed for monthly payments are all but unknown.<br> <br>You grow a decent garden in black, river-bottom soil, raise chickens for eggs, meat and hackle, heat with wood you cut yourself, and hunt, fish and forage for at least some of the groceries. You learn, among other things, that as satisfying as subsistence is, it&#x2019;s a full-time job that will be hard to maintain. The garden goes first. You&#x2019;ve begun to travel a lot during the growing season, and the hippie girl next door who agrees to weed and water it for a share of the harvest sometimes gets distracted and forgets.<br> <br>You meet another girl with those big, dark eyes you could never resist. Woman, actually. It&#x2019;s been a while now since either of you were kids. She&#x2019;s a writer herself and comes from a long line of Great Lakes fishermen, so those are two things you don&#x2019;t have to explain. You&#x2019;ve been a couple for some time when she heads back to Michigan to fish with her family. When you drop her off at the airport, you jokingly say, &#x201c;Catch a fish for me.&#x201d; When you pick her up a week later, a crate large enough to hold a railroad tie rolls onto the baggage carousel. She says, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s your fish.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a thirty-pound Chinook salmon.

Beginning with its first publication as a cautionary tale on the perils of seduction, written in reaction to the licentiousness of the court of Louis XIV, Orenstein traces the many lives the tale has lived since then, from its appearance in modern advertisements for cosmetics and automobiles, the inspiration it brought to poets such as Anne Sexton, and its starring role in pornographic films. In <i>Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked</i>, Red appears as seductress, hapless victim, riot grrrrl, femme fatale, and even she-wolf, as Orenstein shows how through centuries of different guises, the story has served as a barometer of social and sexual mores pertaining to women. Full of fascinating history, generous wit, and intelligent analysis, <i>Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked</i> proves that the story of one young girl's trip through the woods continues to be one of our most compelling modern myths.</p><p>Choosing one of the few fairy tales that does not conclude with a wedding, Catherine Orenstein reinterprets the many versions of "Little Red Riding Hood" by setting the tale against the mores and values of its times. The result is a highly entertaining and interesting conversation about one of our best-known stories.<p> Starting with the first-known published version, Orenstein points out Charles Perrault's lesson to young girls entering the lascivious and political court of Louis XIV. She traces the story further back to a shockingly playful rendition that includes <i>bzous</i> (werewolves) and cannibalism. In this version, she revives the symbolism that relates to the feminine by pointing out the odd questions of the <i>bzou</i>: "Which path are you taking... the path of needles or the path of pins?" Orenstein also takes a look at more modern versions, including Anne Sexton's poem "Red Riding Hood" and Matthew Bright's film <i>Freeway</i>, taking on, as she examines these and other modern versions of the old tale, the machismo wolf and the Gen-X grrrl.</p><p> Though expansive in her research, Orenstein's interpretations are occasionally too simplistic. In "Grandmother's Tale," Riding Hood's cannibalistic meal of her grandmother is reduced to a "symbolic reminder that the old will be reborn in the young." There is nothing mentioned of the talking cat who decries Riding Hood, saying, "She is a slut who eats the flesh and drinks the blood of her granny!" But what Orenstein lacks in depth, she more than makes up for in her encompassing study. In all, 10 tales are examined, as well as a vast historical study of the times they were published. Written with lively prose, Orenstein has produced a book that will spark thought and conversation, encouraging readers to find the wolf, the grandmother, and the little girl within. <i>--Karin Rosman</i></p><b>Catherine Orenstein</b> is a writer whose work has appeared in the <i>Washington Post</i>, the <i>San Francisco Examiner, Ms.</i>, the <i>New York Times </i>Op-Ed page and other publications.

During World War II, in the North African/Mediterranean and European Theaters of Operation, 96 American soldiers were convicted by Army General Courts-Martial and executed for desertion, murder and rape. Their victims were 26 fellow American soldiers and 71 British, French, Italian, Polish and Algerian civilians. The executions were not ad hoc killings. General Eisenhower, or another theater commander, approved every proceeding, but the Army did not trumpet the crimes. After the war, the Army searched for a suitable site to inter the remains of all 96 men. It chose a plot of land adjacent to but technically outside of the World War I American cemetery of Oise-Aisne. The area is separated from the main cemetery by a high stone wall, concealed from view, and is closed to casual visitors. Called, Plot E, by the staff, others refer to it as, The Fifth Field. The judicial files on the 96 were even harder to find until now.</p><p>For over thirty-four years, Colonel French L. MacLean, United States Army, (Ret.), served with many of the leading lights of the United States Army in the latter half of the Twentieth Century Generals with the names Shinseki, Abizaid, Dempsey, Petraeus, Meigs, Saint, Joulwan, Hendrix, Maddox, Wallace, Rodriguez, Brown, Campbell, Jordan, Anderson, Riggs, Goff, Funk, Blackwell and many others. Born in Peoria, Illinois, he graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1974, the second class that, The stars shined on. Commissioned in the Infantry, he served four tours of duty in Germany, commanded two companies and a battalion, attended the School for Advanced Military Studies, fought as a battalion operations officer in a mechanized infantry battalion during Operation Desert Storm in Kuwait and Iraq and served as the historian for the U.S. Army Fifth Corps during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 in Iraq. He additionally served as the Inspector General for the U.S. Army in Europe, and as a course director and professor at the National War College in Washington, DC, where he taught military strategy to many of the military s future leaders of this century. Knowing countless officers and non-commissioned officers, growing up as a scout platoon leader, armored cavalry troop commander, military historian, and one of the Army s senior Inspector Generals, Colonel MacLean knows where to look to find the keys to the Army s historical secrets in this case literally where all the bodies were buried. In addition to the acclaimed, Custer s Best: The Story of Company M, 7th Cavalry at the Little Bighorn, he is the author of ten books on World War II. He recently wrote a fictional EBook on Nazi war criminals.

Audacious maybe, but his statement renewed debate on the meaning of this highly contentious term. Dealing primarily with the post-1996 era shaped by digital technologies and defined by consumer choice and brand marketing, this book brings together leading scholars, established journalists and experienced broadcasters working in the field of contemporary television to debate what we currently mean by quality TV. They go deep into contemporary American television fictions, from "The Sopranos" and "The West Wing", to "CSI" and "Lost" - innovative, sometimes controversial, always compelling dramas, which one scholar has described as 'now better than the movies!' But how do we understand the emergence of these kinds of fiction? Are they genuinely new? What does quality TV have to tell us about the state of today's television market? And is this a new Golden Age of quality TV? Original, often polemic, each chapter proposes new ways of thinking about and defining quality TV.<br>There is a foreword from Robert Thompson, and heated dialogue between British and US television critics. Also included - and a great coup - are interviews with W. Snuffy Walden (scored "The West Wing" among others) and with David Chase ("The Sopranos" creator). "Quality TV" provides throughout groundbreaking and innovative theoretical and critical approaches to studying television and for understanding the current - and future - TV landscape.</p></p><p>Janet McCabe is Research Associate (TV Drama) at Manchester Metropolitan University.

Ten never came back. This is the story of that crew&#x2014;where they came from, how they trained, what it was like to fly a B-24 through enemy flak, and who was waiting for them to come home.Historian Thomas Childers, nephew of the <i>Black Cat</i>'s radio operator, has reconstructed the lives and tragic deaths of these men through their letters home and through in-depth interviews, both with their families and with German villagers who lived near the crash site. In so doing he unearths confusion about the exact number of crash survivors and ugly rumors of their fate at the hands of the German villagers. His search to determine what really happened leads him to the crash site outside of Regensburg to lay the mystery to rest.In the tradition of <i>Young Men and Fire, Wings of Morning</i> is history as commemoration-an evocation of people and events that brings to life a story of love, loss, and a family's quest for truth.</p><p>Thomas Childers is a professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania.After their son died when flak destroyed his plane on April 21, 1945, the parents of Howard Goodner endured the frustrating process of finding out from the War Department exactly what happened. They never did find out. In 1992, Goodner's mother died, having kept through the years a cache of letters her son had written home. They inspired Childers, nephew to the long-dead airman and a professional historian of Nazi electoral politics, to reconstruct his uncle Howard's and his crewmates' wartime experiences. This result, a searching and emotional exploration, powerfully evokes the tension and relaxation cycle of flying combat missions, and as Childers builds toward the fateful day, he deeply and deftly involves readers to the extent that Goodner and comrades seem to be their own relatives and their own inconsolable losses. Quite a literary feat. As Childers stands on the spot from which his uncle departed on the last (and unnecessary) mission, as he presses toward the truth through witnesses to the crash and the relative documents, it must be a stony heart that doesn't share his sorrow and tears. Imaginative and emotive, and factually unerring, this outstanding remembrance is possibly the most original title among this year's anniversary works. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>The Refrigerator Monologues</h2><p>The lives of six female superheroes and the girlfriends of superheroes.

I&#x2019;m comfortable with the word. You wouldn&#x2019;t believe how comfortable the dead can get. We don&#x2019;t tiptoe.<br> <br>Dead. Dead. Dead. Flying Ace of the Corpse Corps. Stepping the light Deathtastic. I don&#x2019;t actually know what a doornail is, but we have a lot in common. Dying was the biggest thing that ever happened to me. I&#x2019;m famous for it. If you know the name Paige Embry, you know that Paige Embry died. She died at night. She died stupidly. She died for no reason. She fell off a bridge like a suicide leap and nobody caught her. She dropped into the water, her spine snapped, and the last things she probably saw was those astonishing lights in the sky, the lights of Doctor Nocturne&#x2019;s infernal machine igniting every piece of metal in the city, turning skyscrapers into liquid purple fire while Kid Mercury punched the bad guy over and over again, maybe because he was grieving already, maybe because he loved fighting more than girls and it was his biggest fight yet, maybe because that&#x2019;s what the script of his life told him to do, maybe because he couldn&#x2019;t stop. Paige Embry died watching her boyfriend save New York City. When the fires went out in Manhattan, they went out in her eyes, too.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s nice to be famous for something, I guess.<br> <br>And the thing about me is, I&#x2019;m not coming back. Lots of people do, you know. Deadtown has pretty shitty border control. If you know somebody on the outside, somebody who knows a guy, a priest or a wizard or a screenwriter or a guy whose superpower shtick gets really dark sometimes or a scientist with a totally neat revivification ray who just can&#x2019;t seem to get federal funding, you can go home again.<br> <br>But we go steady, Death and me. Nobody can tear us apart.<br> <br>Not everybody wants to go back. Life&#x2019;s okay in Deadtown. The early bird special lasts all day and the gas is free. There&#x2019;s no fiery rings of artisanal punishment down here. Just neighborhoods. Blackstones. Bodegas. Walk-up apartments with infinite floors. The subways run on time. Yeah, sure, there&#x2019;s skulls and femurs and gargoyles all over the place and the architects never met a shade of black they didn&#x2019;t like, but hey&#x2014;good design is all about a unified aesthetic. You get used to it. It starts to feel like home. And the gargoyles are really nice guys. The one living on my balcony is called Brian. He has three heads and he&#x2019;s super into slam poetry. Deadtown is like anyplace else. It&#x2019;s scary at first, but you get into a rhythm. Find a favorite park. Put a couple of pictures up on your wall. Pretty soon, you can&#x2019;t imagine living anywhere else.<br> <br>Not everyone adjusts. I&#x2019;ve seen girls run down the main drag toward the EXIT sign with smiles on their faces that would break you in half. Then again, I&#x2019;ve seen others dragged back to the land of the living, screaming and sobbing and clawing through the dirt till their fingernails snap off and their mouths fill up with snot.<br> <br>But not me. No way. No how. If there&#x2019;s a constant in the universe, it&#x2019;s that Paige Embry is dead. I am a permanent error page. 404: Girl Not Found. Oh, sure, I know a guy on the outside. A pretty damn powerful guy. A guy with the speed of a maglev train, the brainpower of a supercomputer, and the strength of a half-dozen Hollywood Hercules. A guy who can slalom between skyscrapers like gravity forgot to take down his name and number. But he&#x2019;s never once peeked in on me. Never once caught me, in all the times I&#x2019;ve fallen. I hear he&#x2019;s dating now. We do get the news here in Deadtown. Every morning in four colors. He&#x2019;s got somebody prettier than a lipstick ad who&#x2019;ll stay home while he fights crime, waving from a window in a goddamn apron. I bet she lives forever.<br> <br>I think about Tom Thatcher a lot. Kid Mercury. I came up with that name, you know. He wanted to call himself Mr. Mercury. But I said, Tommy, that sounds like a car dealership. You&#x2019;re eighteen. You&#x2019;re not even halfway to being a Mister yet. We&#x2019;re still kids, you and me.<br> <br>The thing I hate about being dead is you can&#x2019;t move on. I was in love with him when I died, so I&#x2019;ll be in love with him till the sun burns out. I used to say that actual thing, curled up next to Tom in bed, my leg draped over Kid Mercury&#x2019;s marvelous thigh, as romantic as a heart-shaped balloon.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ll love you till the sun burns out.<br> <br>Well, now it&#x2019;s factually, actually true and it is just a huge bummer. I&#x2019;m frozen. I&#x2019;m stuck. I&#x2019;m Paige Embry forever, the Paige Embry that died with all that violet flame flickering in her blank eyes. I can never be anyone else. I can never see a therapist or eat all the ice cream ever made or go out with my friends and drunk-dial him and tell him I hate him and I never came when he fucked me, not even once, not even after he got his powers, and then call again in the morning and apologize and hide in my couch watching a million episodes of Law &amp; Order all in a row. I don&#x2019;t get to start dating again. I get to wait in a black window for a guy who&#x2019;s never coming home.<br> <br>At least it&#x2019;s a nice window.<br> <br>But one thing the dead do love is telling our stories. We get to take our stories with us. They don&#x2019;t take up a lick of room in the suitcase. Most days I leave my apartment in Hell&#x2019;s Kitchen (actual Hell&#x2019;s actual Kitchen), go down to the Lethe Caf�, order a cup of nothing, look out the window at the blue-gas burntbone streetlamps, and wait for the girls. Ladies who lunch. Ladies who lost. You don&#x2019;t have to be lonely down here if you don&#x2019;t want to be. They come one by one, all big eyes and long legs, tucking strands of loose hair behind their ears, carrying pocketbooks and hats and secret griefs. Julia, Pauline, Daisy, Bayou, Samantha and more and others. Every time they open the frosted-glass door a gust of autumn leaves and moonlight blows in and sticks against the legs of the tables. They apologize to Neil, the gargoyle behind the espresso machine. He shakes his big woolly wolfshead, pulls a black ristretto shot of emptiness and says, Don&#x2019;t you worry about it, honey.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s always autumn in Deadtown. It&#x2019;s always the middle of the night, even at nine in the morning.<br> <br>We call ourselves the Hell Hath Club.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a lot of us. We&#x2019;re mostly very beautiful and very well-read and very angry. We have seen some shit. Our numbers change&#x2014;a few more this week, a few less next, depending on if anyone gets called up to the big game. You can&#x2019;t keep your lunch date if some topside science jockey figures out how to make a zombie-you. We&#x2019;re totally understanding about that sort of thing. She&#x2019;ll be back. They always come back. Zombies never last, power sputters out, and clones don&#x2019;t have the self-preservation instinct God gave a toddler in a stove shop.<br> <br>I watch them come and go and, sometimes, for a minute, I think that sweet-faced geek in his lab will reanimate my rotting corpse for once. But he never looks twice at me. Never picked myself for the team for all eternity.<br> <br>I guess you could call me the President of the Hell Hath Club. It&#x2019;s honorary and empty and mostly means I get to the caf� first and hold our table. I order for everyone. I keep the minutes, such as they are. And when the girls settle in, we open our stories up like the morning edition. News, sports, stocks, funny pages. It&#x2019;s all right there, neat and tidy and well-crafted and finished. Everything that ever happened to us. With a big fat D-Day headline over the part where magic became real, superheroes hit the scene, and the world went absolutely, unashamedly, giggles-and-lollipops-for-good-behavior crazy.</p><h2>The Crimson King (The Horus Heresy)</h2><p>Exiled, hunted and reviled, the Thousand Sons Legion are adrift &#x2013; as is their primarch, Magnus. But with his power and personality fracturing, drastic action is needed by the Legion if they are to avoid losing their gene-father forever.<br><br>After the razing of Prospero, Magnus the Red spirited the Thousand Sons away to the aptly un-named Planet of the Sorcerers, deep within the Eye of Terra. Removed from the concerns of the galaxy at large and regarding the Warmaster&#x2019;s unfolding Heresy with cold detachment, he has dedicated his hollow existence to the preservation of all the knowledge once held in the great libraries of Tizca, should mankind ever seek such enlightenment again. But his sons can see the change in their primarch &#x2013; he is a broken soul, whose mind and memories are slipping away into the tumult of the warp. Only by returning to the scenes of his greatest triumphs and tragedies can they hope to restore him, and allow the Crimson King to be crowned anew by the Ruinous Powers.</p><p>Graham McNeill has written many Horus Heresy novels, including The Crimson King, Vengeful Spirit and his New York Times bestsellers A Thousand Sons and the novella The Reflection Crack&#x2019;d, which featured in The Primarchs anthology. Graham&#x2019;s Ultramarines series, featuring Captain Uriel Ventris, is now six novels long, and has close links to his Iron Warriors stories, the novel Storm of Iron being a perennial favourite with Black Library fans. He has also written the Forges of Mars trilogy, featuring the Adeptus Mechanicus.

She has a first-kiss tree and a broken-arm tree. She has a car-accident tree. There is a tree at the hospital where Jackie&#x2019;s mother passed away into the long good night. When one of them gets cut down, Jackie doesn&#x2019;t know what to do but she doesn&#x2019;t let that stop her. She picks up the biggest rock she can carry and puts it through the window of a car. Smash. She intends to leave before the police arrive, but they&#x2019;re early. Ann is Jackie&#x2019;s best friend, but she&#x2019;s got problems of her own. Her mother is chained up in the basement. How do you bring that up in casual conversation? Oh, sorry I&#x2019;ve been so distant, Jackie. My mother has more teeth than she&#x2019;s supposed to, and she won&#x2019;t eat anything that&#x2019;s already dead.&#x201d; Ann and her sister Margaret don&#x2019;t have much of a choice here. Their mother needs to be fed. It isn&#x2019;t easy but this is family. It&#x2019;s not supposed to be easy. It&#x2019;ll be okay as long as Margaret and Ann still have each other. Add in a cantankerous old man, his powerfully stupid dog, a headless ghost, a lesbian crush and a few unsettling visits from Jackie&#x2019;s own dead mother, and you&#x2019;ll find that One Bloody Thing After Another is a different sort of horror novel from the ones you&#x2019;re used to. It&#x2019;s as sad and funny as it is frightening, and it is as much about the way families rely on each other as it is about blood being drooled on the carpet. Though, to be honest, there is a lot of blood being drooled on the carpet.</p></p><p><p><b>Joey Comeau</b> is the author of <i>Lockpick Pornography</i>, <i>Overqualified</i>, and<i> Too Late to Say I'm Sorry</i>, as well as the popular web comic <i>A Softer World</i>.

Since the beginning of the new millennium, numerous historical and critical works have established sound art as an artistic genre in its own right, with an accepted genealogy that begins with Futurism, Dada, and Fluxus, as well as disciplinary classifications that effectively restrict artistic practice to particular tools and venues. This book, companion volume to a massive exhibition at ZKM | Karlsruhe, goes beyond these established disciplinary divides to chart the evolution and the full potential of sound as a medium of art. The book begins with an extensive overview by volume editor Peter Weibel that considers the history of sound as media art, examining work by visual artists, composers, musicians, and architects alike. Subsequent essays examine sound experiments in antiquity, sonification of art and science, and internet-based sound art. Contributors then survey the global field of sound art research and practice, in essays that describe the past, present, and future of sound art in Germany, Japan, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, Canada, Turkey, Australia, and Scandinavia. The texts are accompanied by an extensive photographic documentation of the ZKM exhibition.</p><p><b>Texts by</b></p><p>Achille Bonito Oliva, Dmitry Bulatov, Germano Celant, Seth Cluett, Christoph Cox, Julia Gerlach, Ryo Ikeshiro und/and Atau Tanaka, Caleb Kelly, Brandon LaBelle, Christof Migone, L�szl� Moholy-Nagy, Daniel Muzyczuk, Tony Myatt, Irene Noy, Giuliano Obici, Carsten Seiffarth und/and Bernd Schulz, Basak Senova, Linnea Semmerling, Morten S�ndergaard, Alexandra Supper, David Toop und/and Adam Parkinson, Peter Weibel, Dajuin Yao, Siegfried Zielinski</p></p><p>Peter Weibel is Chairman and CEO of the ZKM | Center for Art and Media, Karlsruhe.

Drawing from the oral history of his people before the coming of Europeans, the recorded history since, and his own lifetime among them, John Joseph Mathews created a truly epic history.<br><br> This account of the Osages, a Siouan tribe once centered in the area now occupied by St. Louis, later on small streams in southwestern Missouri and southeastern Kansas, then in northeastern Oklahoma, is a spiritual one. Their quest in the centuries-long record was for the meaning of Wah&#x2019;Kon-Tah, the Great Mysteries. In war, in peace, in camps and villages, in their land of the Middle Waters, the Osages met all of the changes and hardships people are likely to meet anywhere.<br><br> Mathews tells the Osages&#x2019; story with rare poetical feeling, in rhythms of language and with dramatic insights that surpass even his first book, <i>Wah&#x2019;Kon-Tah: The Osage and the White Man&#x2019;s Road</i>, which was selected by a major book club when published in 1932. Mathews managed his vast canvas with consummate skill, marking him as one of the major interpreters of American Indian life and history.<br></p><p><b>John Joseph Mathews</b> (1895&#x2013;1979), a mixed-blood Osage, was the author of &nbsp;<i>Wah&#x2019;Kon-Tah: The Osage and the White Man&#x2019;s Road</i>;<i></i><i>Talking to the Moon</i>;<i> Sundown</i>;<i> Life and Death of an Oilman: The Career of E.

Now the armies have gathered to see which of Genghis' sons has the strength to be khan. The Mongol empire has been at peace for two years, but whoever survives will face the formidable might of their great enemy, China's Song dynasty.The great leader Tsubodai sweeps into the west: through Russia, over the Carpathian mountains and into Hungary.

But at the moment of Tsubodai's greatest triumph, as his furthest scouts reach the northern mountains of Italy, Tsubodai must make a decision that will change the course of history forever.</p></p><p><p>Conn Iggulden secured his place as a master storyteller of historical fiction with the success of his Emperor series; each book, based on the life of Julius Caesar, was a top ten bestseller. Then followed the hit of 2006, The Dangerous Book for Boys, which he co-authored with his brother, Hal. Conn has now written the first instalment of his latest series, Wolf of the Plains, an extraordinary evocation of the life and legacy of Genghis Khan. During the writing process Iggulden travelled to Mongolia and followed in the footsteps of the great conqueror. He lives in Hertfordshire with his wife and children.</p>ONE<br><br>The air swirled with marble dust that glittered as it caught the evening sun. Ogedai's heart was full as he guided his horse down the main thoroughfare, taking in every sight and sound around him. There was a sense of urgency in the cacophony of hammer blows and shouted orders. The Mongol tumans had gathered outside the city. His generals, his people, had been summoned there to see what two years of labor had created: a city in a wilderness, with the Orkhon River tamed and bent to his will.<br><br>Ogedai reined in for a moment to watch a group of workmen unload a cart. Nervous under his gaze, the laborers used ropes, pulleys, and sheer numbers to maneuver blocks of white marble onto low sledges that could be dragged into the workshops. Each milky block was subtly veined in a light blue that pleased Ogedai. He owned the quarry that had birthed the stones, hundreds of miles to the east, just one of a thousand purchases he had made in the last years.<br><br>There was no doubt he had been extravagant, spending gold and silver as if it had no value. He smiled at the thought, wondering what his father would have made of the white city rising in the wilderness. Genghis had despised the anthills of humanity, but these were not the ancient stones and teeming streets of an enemy. This was new and it belonged to the nation.<br><br>There had never been a treasury like the one he had inherited, amassed from the wealth of China and Khwarezm, yet never spent by its khan. With the tribute from Yenking alone, Ogedai could have sheathed every new home in white marble or even jade if he had wanted. He had built a monument to his father on the plains, as well as a place where he himself could be khan. He had built a palace with a tower that rose above the city like a white sword, so that all men could see the nation had come far from simple gers and herds.<br><br>For his gold, a million men had come to work. They had crossed plains and deserts with just a few animals and tools, coming from as far off as Chin lands or the cities of Samarkand, Bukhara, and Kabul. Masons and carpenters from Koryo had made the journey, called to the west by rumors of a new city being built on a river of coins. Bulgars brought stocks of rare clays, charcoal, and hardwood in great caravans from their forests. The city filled with traders, builders, potters, foodsellers, thieves, and scoundrels. Farmers scenting a profit brought their carts for days of travel, all for the strings of metal coins. Ogedai gave them gold and silver from the earth, melted and shaped. In return they gave him a city, and he did not find it a bad bargain. For the present, they were the colorful crowds of his city, speaking a hundred tongues and cooking a thousand different foods and spices. Some of them would be allowed to stay, but he was not building it for them.<br><br>Ogedai saw green-handed dyers flatten themselves against the walls, their red turbans dipping in respect. His Guards cleared the way ahead, so the son of Genghis could ride almost in a dream. He had made this place from the camp of gers his father had known. He had made it real, in stone.<br><br>It still amazed him. He had not paid for women to travel with his workers, but they had come with their husbands and fathers. He had wondered for a time how he would establish the businesses every city needed to thrive, but traders had approached his chancellor, offering horses or more silver to lease new properties. The city was more than a simple collection of houses. Already it had a vitality of its own, far beyond his control.<br><br>Yet not completely. A quirk in the plans had created an area of small alleyways in the south of his city. Criminal gangs had begun to flourish there until Ogedai heard. He had ordered eight hundred buildings torn down, the whole area redesigned and rebuilt. His own Guard had supervised the hangings.<br><br>The street fell quiet as he passed, the laborers and their masters bowing their heads as they saw the man who held the power of life and death and gold over all of them. Ogedai took a deep breath of the dusty air, enjoying the taste of it on his tongue and the thought that he was literally breathing in his creation. Ahead, he could see the towers of his palace, crowned in a dome of gold beaten thinner than the paper of his scribes. It raised his spirits to see it, like sunlight trapped and held in his city.<br><br>The street widened as it grew before him, its stone gutters polished. That section had been finished months before and the bustling crowds of laborers fell behind. As Ogedai trotted on, he could not help glancing at the boundary walls that had so confused his Chin architects and laborers. Even from the low vantage point of a saddle, there were moments when he could see over them to the green plains beyond. The walls of Yenking had not saved that city from fire or siege, he knew. His walls were the warriors of the khan, the tribes who had brought a Chin emperor to his knees and razed a shah's cities.<br><br>Already, Ogedai loved his creation, from the vast expanse of the central training ground, to the red-tiled roofs, the paved gutters, the temples and churches and mosques and markets and homes by the thousand, most still empty and waiting for life. Scraps of blue cloth fluttered in the plains wind on every corner, a tribute to the sky father above them all. In the south, green foothills and mountains stretched far away and the air was warm with dust as Ogedai rejoiced in Karakorum.<br><br>The twilight was deepening into a soft gloom as Ogedai handed his reins to a servant and strode up the steps to his palace. Before he entered, he looked back once more at the city straining to be born. He could smell fresh-turned earth and, over it, the fried food of the workmen on the evening air. He had not planned the herds of livestock in corrals beyond the walls, or the squawking chickens sold on every corner. He thought of the wool market that had sprung up by the western gate. He should not have expected trade to halt simply because the city was unfinished. He had chosen a spot on an ancient traders' road to give it life--and life had begun pouring in while whole streets, whole districts, were still piles of lumber, tile, and stone.<br><br>As he looked into the setting sun, he smiled at the cooking fires on the plains surrounding the city. His people waited there, for him. His armies would be fed on rich mutton, dripping fat from the summer grass. It reminded him of his own hunger, and he moistened his lips as he passed through a stone gate the equal of anything in a Chin city.<br><br>In the echoing hall beyond, he paused for a moment at his most extravagant gesture. A tree of solid silver stretched gracefully up to the arched ceiling, where the center point was open to the sky like the ger of any herdsman. It had taken the silversmiths of Samarkand almost a year to cast and polish, but it served his purpose. Whoever entered his palace would see it and be staggered at the wealth it represented. Some would see an emblem for the silver people, the Mongol tribes who had become a nation. Those with more wisdom would see that the Mongols cared so little for silver that they used it as a casting metal.<br><br>Ogedai let his hand slide down the bole of the tree, feeling the metal chill his fingers. The spreading branches reached out in a parody of life, gleaming like a white birch in moonlight. Ogedai nodded to himself. He stretched his back as lamps were lit by slaves and servants all around him, throwing black shadows and making the evening seem suddenly darker outside.<br><br>He heard hurrying footsteps and saw his manservant, Baras'aghur, approaching. Ogedai winced at the man's keen expression and the bundle of papers under his arm.<br><br>"After I have eaten, Baras. It has been a long day."<br><br>"Very well, my lord, but you have a visitor: your uncle. Shall I tell him to wait on your pleasure?"<br><br>Ogedai paused in the act of unbuckling his sword belt. All three of his uncles had come to the plains around Karakorum at his order, gathering their tumans in great camps. He had forbidden them all from entering the city, and he wondered who would have disobeyed him. He suspected it would be Khasar, who regarded orders and laws as tools for other men rather than himself.<br><br>"Who is it, Baras?" Ogedai asked quietly.<br><br>"Lord Temuge, master. I have sent servants to tend him, but he has been waiting now for a long time."<br><br>Baras'aghur made a gesture to indicate a sweep of the sun in the sky, and Ogedai pursed his lips in irritation. His father's brother would be well aware of the nuances of hospitality. Simply by arriving when Ogedai was not there to greet him, he had created an obligation. Ogedai assumed it was deliberate. A man like Temuge was too subtle not to grasp the slightest advantage. Yet the order had gone out for the generals and princes to remain on the plains.<br><br>Ogedai sighed. For two years, he had readied Karakorum to be the jewel in an empire. His had been a splendid isolation and he had maneuvered to keep it so, his enemies and friends always off balance. He had known it could not last forever. He steeled himself as he walked after Baras'aghur to the first and most sumptuous of his audience rooms.<br><br>"Have wine brought to me immediately, Baras. And food--something simple, such as the warriors are eating on the plain."<br><br>"Your will, my lord," his servant said without listening, his thoughts on the meeting to come.<br><br>The footsteps of the two men were loud in the silent halls, clicking and echoing back to them. Ogedai did not glance at the painted scenes that usually gave him so much pleasure. He and Baras'aghur walked under the best work of Islamic artists, and it was only toward the end that Ogedai looked up at a blaze of color, smiling to himself at the image of Genghis leading a charge at the Badger's Mouth pass. The artist had asked a fortune for a year's work, but Ogedai had doubled his price when he saw it. His father still lived on those walls, as well as in his memory. There was no art of painting in the tribes he knew, and such things could still make him g...</p><h2>Invisible Heroes of World War II: Extraordinary Wartime Stories of Ordinary People</h2><p><i>Invisible Heroes of World War II,</i> documents ten fascinating true stories of a diverse group of soldiers and noncombatants from all over the world, including African Americans, women, and Native Americans, who fought with the Allies during World War II. These heroes made significant contributions in the war effort, and sometimes gave their lives for freedom and liberty, often without much recognition or fanfare. Some were frontline soldiers who were captured by the enemy and endured horrific conditions as POWs, others were ordinary citizens who fought in the French Resistance and provided vital operations to undermine Nazi occupation, while others were engineers, workers in industry, or war correspondents and photographers. All served with valor and distinction as part of the massive Allied forces who fought to free the world from tyranny and oppression.</p><p>Jerry Borrowman is an award-winning author of historical fiction and nonfiction. He has written about the World Wars, the Great Depression, and the Vietnam War. His book, <i>Compassionate Soldier</i>, was the recipient of the George Washington National Medal of Freedom Foundation at Valley Forge and the Best Indies Book of the Year 2017 Gold Winner for War and Military. He and his wife, Marcella, raised four children and live in the Rocky Mountains.Gr 8 Up-World War II famously gave rise to human atrocities such as the Holocaust and the atomic bomb, but it also became a proving ground for heroes who refused to back down from the fight against evil. This title tells the stories of many of these brave soldiers and noncombatants spanning both the European and Pacific theaters. Profiles range from a survivor of the deadly Battan Death March to a female French resistance commander to the combat engineers who provided the infrastructure for troops to advance into battle. The first half shares stories of individuals from the war, two of which are previously untold and were discovered by a personal connection to the author. The second half focuses on often overlooked groups such as the Navajo code talkers and the Purple Heart Battalion. Each of these group descriptions includes several anecdotes from individuals involved. The short biographical sketches are well cited and include quotes from both the cast of heroes and speeches honoring them in later years when applicable. Difficult topics such as torture and personal loss are approached with grace by neither glossing over nor overly examining the experiences. Each individual or group story includes background information, giving readers a chance to see what elements led up to their heroic acts and service during the conflict. VERDICT A solid primer for those just learning about World War II, this collection also offers new stories that will interest even the most avid history buff.-Emily Beasley, Omaha Public Schools&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

No redistribution permitted.</p><h2>The Whore&#39;s Child: Stories</h2><p>To this irresistible debut collection of short stories, Richard Russo brings the same bittersweet wit, deep knowledge of human nature, and spellbinding narrative gifts that distinguish his best-selling novels. His themes are the imperfect bargains of marriage; the discoveries and disillusionments of childhood;the unwinnable battles men and women insist on fighting with the past. <br><br> A cynical Hollywood moviemaker confronts his dead wife&#x2019;s lover and abruptly realizes the depth of his own passion. As his parents&#x2019; marriage disintegrates, a precocious fifth-grader distracts himself with meditations on baseball, spaghetti, and his place in the universe. And in the title story, an elderly nun enters a college creative writing class and plays havoc with its tidy notions of fact and fiction. <b>The Whore&#x2019;s Child</b> is further proof that Russo is one of the finest writers we have, unsparingly truthful yet hugely compassionate and capable of creating characters real that they seem to step off the page.</p><p>In <i>The Whore's Child</i>, Richard Russo's first collection of short fiction, the 2002 Pulitzer Prize-wining author of <i>Empire Falls</i> explores difficult emotional territory while retaining the assured wisdom and humor of his best work. Infidelity, self-reflection, and the fallibility of memory come into consideration in this entertaining and perceptive collection. The book's titular story sets the tone for the whole: an elderly nun crashes a college writing workshop and composes her own life story, sharing the details of her childhood growing up in a convent as the abandoned daughter of a prostitute. As her troubling story unfolds, the class realizes the fictions she has unknowingly imposed upon it. Other stories examine familial relationships and responsibility: the bittersweet "Joyride" follows the desperate road trip of a mother and son, each running from troubles they won't admit to. The collection's best and most lighthearted story, "The Mysteries of Linwood Hart," explores the daydreaming, curious mind of 10-year-old Linwood as he ponders the self-defeating behavior of his family, the desires of inanimate objects, and his perceived place at the center of the universe. Russo surveys these subjects with skilled ease and accuracy, communicating a quiet understanding of his characters and their personal yet universal concerns. Russo, like Flannery O'Connor, has a gift for conveying the absurdity and severity of everyday life with brutal honesty, humor, and compassion: <blockquote>It was an awful place, but Lin understood it was as perfectly real as every place else in the world, which was large beyond imagining, containing every single place he himself had ever been or never would see in his entire life.</blockquote> Uncommon in its natural insight, <i>The Whore's Child</i> recognizes the often unwelcome realities of experience and is all the more exceptional for it. <i>--Ross Doll</i>&#x201c;An author whose laid-back understatements can be as sharp as other writers&#x2019; boldest declarations....the architect of stories you can&#x2019;t put down.&#x201d; --<i>The New York Times</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;[Russo] has joined those writers who can be said to have coined their own universe....

Jan lives in a seacoast town in Massachusetts, close to where she grew up. During the summer her family moves to a home in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts.PreSchool-Grade 2 A story for Mother's Day, for spring, for any day. Three mouse brothers, clad in bright plaid shirts and lederhosen, leave their snug cottage, intent upon finding the perfect gifts for their mother. Their early morning search is filled with dangers: a snake hidden in the thick underbush, a fox running by. However, the mice are brave, and hand-in-tail, they traipse through brush and briars to find their presents. In the end, it is Little Mouse, returning empty-handed, who has the best surprise of all: a song. The perspective is from a mouse's vantage point: toadstools and ferns seem like trees; a ripe, juicy strawberry is so big that Middle Mouse can barely carry his gift in his two arms; a dandelion fluff ball towers over Biggest Mouse. Through deft, simple lines, Brett captures the brothers' fear, their enjoyment of the sights, smells and sounds of their world and finally, their sheer delight at finding just the right gifts for their appreciative mother. The finely honed details, the soft colors, the expressions of love and sharing make this a story that is as fresh and harmonious as Little Mouse's song.

Indigenous tribes speak of ancestors who fled there to escape the Spanish invaders, and they warn that anyone who enters this sacred city will fall ill and die. In 1940, swashbuckling journalist Theodore Morde returned from the rainforest with hundreds of artifacts and an electrifying story of having found the Lost City of the Monkey God-but then committed suicide without revealing its location.<br>Three quarters of a century later, bestselling author Doug Preston joined a team of scientists on a groundbreaking new quest. In 2012 he climbed aboard a rickety, single-engine plane carrying the machine that would change everything: lidar, a highly advanced, classified technology that could map the terrain under the densest rainforest canopy. In an unexplored valley ringed by steep mountains, that flight revealed the unmistakable image of a sprawling metropolis, tantalizing evidence of not just an undiscovered city but an enigmatic, lost civilization.<br>Venturing into this raw, treacherous, but breathtakingly beautiful wilderness to confirm the discovery, Preston and the team battled torrential rains, quickmud, disease-carrying insects, jaguars, and deadly snakes. But it wasn't until they returned that tragedy struck: Preston and others found they had contracted in the ruins a horrifying, sometimes lethal-and incurable-disease.<br>Suspenseful and shocking, filled with colorful history, hair-raising adventure, and dramatic twists of fortune, THE LOST CITY OF THE MONKEY GOD is the absolutely true, eyewitness account of one of the great discoveries of the twenty-first century.<br></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of January 2017:</strong> In 2012, author Douglas Preston joined a team of explorers searching for Ciudad Blanca (&#x201c;The White City&#x201d;), a legendary ruin hidden in the dense jungle of eastern Honduras. To this point the city &#x2013; also known as &#x201c;the Lost City of the Monkey God&#x201d; - was literally a legend; while various hucksters and hoaxers had claimed to have discovered the abandoned metropolis, no credible evidence had ever been presented, and its very existence remained shrouded in doubt. In addition to the objective hazards of tropical disease, wild boars, and the deadly fer-de-lance viper, locals stoked the mystique, describing various curses awaiting would-be discoverers. Don&#x2019;t pick the flowers, or you&#x2019;ll die. <p>But this team had an advantage that previous searchers had lacked: LIDAR, an advanced laser-imaging technology able to penetrate the dense jungle canopy &#x2013; just enough &#x2013; and return detailed elevation profiles from which subtle, man-made anomalies could be identified. Almost immediately, two major sites emerged, their scale and architecture indicating a civilization to rival another local, more famous power, the Maya. </p> <p>The announcement had consequences. The fledgling Honduran government, having gained power through a military coup, sought to use the discovery to bolster its status with the population, while the academic community ripped the expedition with accusations of Indiana Jones-style exploitation and shoddy scientific methods, cries which could be uncharitably interpreted as sour grapes. Encroaching deforestation and the prospect of looters created urgency to conduct a ground survey, and the team ventured into the wilderness and all the hazards that awaited, including an unexpected and insidious danger that cursed the team well beyond their return home. </p> <p>The author of over 30 books, including number of bestselling thrillers co-written with Lincoln Child, Preston knows pace, and he packs several narratives into a taut 300 pages. Indiana Jones criticism aside, the story of the discovery and exploration of the ruin is solid adventure writing, and he walks a fine line in dealing with the archaeology community&#x2019;s response, reporting on the bases for their criticism where they chose to provide it. And by invoking Jared Diamond&#x2019;s <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel</em>, Preston speculates on the mysterious, sudden demise of the White City and its inhabitants, drawing ominous parallels between their fate and possibly our own. <em>Lost City</em> is a tale that manages to be both fun and harrowing, a vicarious thrill worthy of a place on the shelf next to David Grann&#x2019;s <em>The Lost City of Z</em>. <em>--Jon Foro, The Amazon Book Review</em></p>The thrillers of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child "stand head and shoulders above their rivals" (<em>Publishers Weekly</em>).

This magnificent version of <i>The Rub�iy�t of Omar Khayy�m</i> reproduces the edition published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton of London in 1909, in which the timeless poems are accompanied by full-color images by Golden Age illustrator Edmund Dulac. Critics and collectors have long debated which book represents the peak of Dulac's career, and many agree that his affinity for Persian art makes this gloriously illustrated volume a strong contender.</p><p>An illustrated gift edition of the quatrains of Omar the tentmaker, which have more admirers today than ever before.

His work encompasses a wide variety of themes and styles, although he preferred to work in watercolors and remains best known for his imaginative illustrations for fairy tales and other children's books. <br>Omar Khayy�m (1048&#x2013;1131) was among the Middle Ages' most influential thinkers. Scholar, astronomer, mathematician, and poet, the Persian philosopher wrote one of&nbsp; the most important pre-modern treatises on algebra but is best remembered for his poetry. <br>Edward FitzGerald (1809&#x2013;1883) was a scion of one of Great Britain's wealthiest families who devoted himself to Oriental studies. His translation of Khayy�m's verse, published anonymously in 1859, initially received little attention but gradually achieved enormous popularity and influence.</p><h2>All That Is Evident Is Suspect: Readings from the Oulipo: 1963 - 2018</h2><p>Since its inception in Paris in 1960, the OuLiPo&#x2015;ouvroir de litt�rature potentielle, or workshop for potential literature&#x2015;has continually expanded our sense of what writing can do. It&#x2019;s produced, among many other marvels, a detective novel without the letter e (and a sequel of sorts without a, i, o, u, or y); an epic poem structured by the Parisian m�tro system; a story in the form of a tarot reading; a poetry book in the form of a game of go; and a suite of sonnets that would take almost 200 million years to read completely.<br><br>Lovers of literature are likely familiar with the novels of the best-known Oulipians&#x2015;Italo Calvino, Georges Perec, Harry Mathews, Raymond Queneau&#x2015;and perhaps even the small number of texts available in English on the group, including Warren Motte&#x2019;s Oulipo: A Primer of Potential Literature and Daniel Levin Becker&#x2019;s Many Subtle Channels: In Praise of Potential Literature. But the actual work of the group in its full, radiant collectivity has never before been showcased in English.

It isn&#x2019;t another expos� about how they broke up. It isn&#x2019;t a history of their gigs or their gear. It is a collection of essays telling the story of what this ubiquitous band means to a generation who grew up with the Beatles music on their parents&#x2019; stereos and their faces on T-shirts. What do the Beatles mean today? Why are they more famous and beloved now than ever? And why do they still matter so much to us, nearly fifty years after they broke up?</p><p>As he did in his previous books,<em> Love is a Mix Tape, Talking to Girls About Duran Duran,</em> and <em>Turn Around Bright Eyes, </em>Sheffield focuses on the emotional connections we make to music. This time, he focuses on the biggest pop culture phenomenon of all time&#x2014;The Beatles. In his singular voice, he explores what the Beatles mean today, to fans who have learned to love them on their own terms and not just for the sake of nostalgia. </p><p><em>Meet the Beatles</em> tells the story of how four lads from Liverpool became the world&#x2019;s biggest pop group, then broke up&#x2014;but then somehow just kept getting bigger. At this point, their music doesn&#x2019;t belong to the past&#x2014;it belongs to right now. This book is a celebration of that music, showing why the Beatles remain the world&#x2019;s favorite thing&#x2014;and how they invented the future we&#x2019;re all living in today.</p><p></p></p><p><p>The Beatles have profoundly touched the lives of millions. But have you ever wondered why? Why did they become the most powerful artists in history and one of the twentieth century's major symbols of cultural transformation? <em>Meet the Beatles</em> answers those questions and more as it examines the ways the lives of John, Paul, George, and Ringo were inextricably tied to the cultural revolutions their music helped inspire. From their long hair and interest in India to their drug use and admiration for strong women, the Beatles changed the way we look, the way we feel, and even the way we think. This is the book for those who have always been infatuated with the Beatles, as well as those who want to learn for the first time what it all really meant.</p><p>Steven D.

Wattles: Including: The Science of Getting Rich, The Science of Being Great &amp; The Science of Being Well</h2><p>The Science of Getting Rich is a book written by the New Thought Movement writer Wallace D. Wattles. The book is still in print after 100 years. It was a major inspiration for Rhonda Byrne&#39;s bestselling book and film The Secret. According to USA Today, the text is &#34;divided into 17 short, straight-to-the-point chapters that explain how to overcome mental barriers, and how creation, not competition, is the hidden key to wealth attraction.&#34; Wattles, who had formerly been a Methodist, ran for office as a Socialist candidate in Indiana in 1916. He included the word science in the title, reflecting a secular approach to New Thought though also thereby borrowing from the then-rampant popularity of Christian Science and its offshoots as he wrote about business prosperity, mind training, and success in the material world. The mental technique that he called &#34;thinking in the Certain Way,&#34; was intended to establish a state of positivity and self-affirmation. The contents, with chapter titles like &#34;How to Use the Will&#34; and &#34;Further Use of the Will&#34; advance Wattles&#39;s concept of the &#34;Certain Way.&#34; Similar keywords about will power, mastery, and success are found in the writings of contemporary early 20th century authors Charles F. Haanel (The Master Key System), the Methodist minister Frank Channing Haddock (Power of Will, Power for Success, Mastery of Self for Wealth Power Success), and Elizabeth Towne (How to Grow Success). The Science of Getting Rich (1910) is a companion volume to the author&#39;s book on health from a New Thought perspective, The Science of Being Well (1910) and his personal self-help book The Science of Being Great (1911). All three were originally issued in matching bindings. The Science of Getting Rich preceded similar financial success books such as The Master Key System by Charles F. Haanel (1912) and Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill (1937). In the 100 years since its publication, it has gone through many editions, and remains in print from more than one publisher. The Science of Getting Rich was credited by Rhonda Byrne as one of the inspirations for her popular 2006 film and 2007 book The Secret. As Byrne explained it on the web site of Oprah Winfrey, &#34;Something inside of me had me turn the pages one by one, and I can still remember my tears hitting the pages as I was reading it. [...] It gave me a glimpse of The Secret. It was like a flame inside of my heart. And with every day since, it&#39;s just become a raging fire of wanting to share all of this with the world.&#34; The book is included in personal development scholar Tom Butler-Bowdon&#39;s list of &#34;50 Success Classics&#34; in his 2004 book of that name.</p><p><b>Wallace D. Wattles</b> was an American author and a pioneer success writer. His most famous work is a book called <i>The Science of Getting Rich</i> in which he explains how to get rich.

Once, humans were benighted by superstition and irrationality, but then the Greeks invented reason. Later, the Enlightenment enshrined rationality as the supreme value. Discovering that reason is the defining feature of our species, we named ourselves the &#x201c;rational animal.&#x201d; But is this flattering story itself rational? In this sweeping account of irrationality from antiquity to today&#x2015;from the fifth-century BC murder of Hippasus for revealing the existence of irrational numbers to the rise of Twitter mobs and the election of Donald Trump&#x2015;Justin Smith says the evidence suggests the opposite. From sex and music to religion and war, irrationality makes up the greater part of human life and history.</p><p>Rich and ambitious, <i>Irrationality</i> ranges across philosophy, politics, and current events. Challenging conventional thinking about logic, natural reason, dreams, art and science, pseudoscience, the Enlightenment, the internet, jokes and lies, and death, the book shows how history reveals that any triumph of reason is temporary and reversible, and that rational schemes, notably including many from Silicon Valley, often result in their polar opposite. The problem is that the rational gives birth to the irrational and vice versa in an endless cycle, and any effort to permanently set things in order sooner or later ends in an explosion of unreason. Because of this, it is irrational to try to eliminate irrationality. For better or worse, it is an ineradicable feature of life.</p><p>Illuminating unreason at a moment when the world appears to have gone mad again, <i>Irrationality</i> is fascinating, provocative, and timely.</p></p><p><b>Justin E.

Even after the revolution, when for purposes of the struggle against &#x2018;the slavery of the kitchen&#x2019;, they actually did away with kitchens in housing blocks, nobody tried to get rid of the courtyards. Every proud Stalinist block that displayed its Potemkin fa�ade to the broad avenue beside it had to have a courtyard &#x2014; large and green, with tables and benches, with a yard-keeper scraping the asphalt clean every morning. Then the age of five-storey sectional housing arrived &#x2014; and the courtyards shrivelled and became bare, the yard-keepers who had been so grave and staid were replaced by yard women, who regarded it as their duty to give little boys who got up to mischief a clip round the ear and upbraid residents who came home drunk. But even so, the courtyards still hung on.<br><br>And then, as if in response to the increased tempo of life, the houses stretched upwards. From nine storeys to sixteen, or even twenty-four. And as if each building was allocated the right only to a certain volume of space, rather than an area of ground, the courtyards withered right back to the entrances and the entrances opened their doors straight onto the public streets, while the male and female yard-keepers disappeared and were replaced by communal services functionaries.<br><br>Okay, so the courtyards came back later, but by no means to all the buildings, as if they&#x2019;d taken offence at being treated so scornfully before. The new courtyards were bounded by high walls, with fit, well-groomed young men sitting in the gate lodges, and car parks concealed under the English lawns. The children in these courtyards played under the supervision of nannies, the drunken residents were helped from their Mercedes and BMWs by bodyguards accustomed to dealing with anything, and the new yard-keepers tidied up the English lawns with German mowers.<br><br>This courtyard was one of the new ones.<br><br>The multistorey towers on the bank of the River Moscow were known throughout Russia. They were the capital&#x2019;s new symbol &#x2014; replacing the faded Kremlin and the TsUM department store, which had become just an ordinary shop. The granite embankment with its own quayside, the entrances finished with Venetian plasterwork, the caf�s and restaurants, the beauty salons and supermarkets and also, of course, the apartments with two or three hundred square metres of floor space. The new Russia probably needed a symbol like this &#x2014; pompous and kitschy, like the thick gold chains that men wore round their necks during the period of initial accumulation of capital. And it didn&#x2019;t matter that most of the apartments that had been bought long ago were still standing empty, the caf�s and restaurants were closed, waiting for better times to come, and the waves lapping against the concrete quayside were dirty.<br><br>The man strolling along the embankment on this warm summer evening had never worn a gold chain. He possessed a keen in-tuition that was more than adequate as a substitute for good taste. He had switched his Chinese-made Adidas tracksuit in good time for a crimson club jacket and then been the first to ditch the crimson jacket in favour of a Versace suit. He was ahead of the game even in the sports that he played, having abandoned his tennis racket for mountain skis a whole month before all the Kremlin officials ... even though at his age the pleasure he could get from skis was limited to standing on them.<br><br>He preferred to live in his mansion house in the Gorki-9 district, only visiting the apartment with the windows overlooking the river when he was with his lover.<br><br>But then, he was planning to get rid of his full-time lover &#x2014; after all, no Viagra can conquer age, and conjugal fidelity was coming back into fashion.<br><br>His driver and bodyguards weren&#x2019;t standing near enough to hear what their employer was saying. But even if the wind did carry snatches of his words to their ears, what was so strange? Why shouldn&#x2019;t a man make conversation with himself as the working day was drawing to a close, standing all alone above the dancing waves? Where could you ever find a more sympathetic listener than your own self?<br><br>&#x2018;Even so, I repeat my proposal ...&#x2019; the man said. &#x2018;I repeat it yet again.&#x2019;<br><br>The stars were shining dimly through the city smog. On the far bank of the river, tiny lights were coming on in the tower blocks that had no courtyards. Only one in five of the beautiful lamps stretching along the quayside was lit &#x2014; and that was only to humour the whim of the important man who had decided to take a stroll by the river.<br><br>&#x2018;I repeat it yet again,&#x2019; the man said in a quiet voice.<br><br>The water splashed against the embankment &#x2014; and with it came the answer.<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s impossible. Absolutely impossible.&#x2019;<br><br>The man on the quayside was not surprised by the voice that came out of empty space. He nodded and asked:<br><br>&#x2018;But what about vampires?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, that&#x2019;s one possibility,&#x2019; his invisible companion agreed. &#x2018;Vampires could initiate you. If you would be happy to exist as non-life ... I won&#x2019;t lie, they don&#x2019;t like sunlight, but it&#x2019;s not fatal to them, and you wouldn&#x2019;t have to give up risotto with garlic ...&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Then what&#x2019;s the problem?&#x2019; the man asked, involuntarily raising his hands to his chest. &#x2018;The soul? The need to drink blood?&#x2019;<br><br>The void laughed quietly.<br><br>&#x2018;Just the hunger. Eternal hunger. And the emptiness inside. You wouldn&#x2019;t like it, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;What else is there?&#x2019; asked the man.<br><br>&#x2018;Werewolves,&#x2019; the voice replied almost jocularly. &#x2018;They can initiate a man too. But werewolves are also one of the lower forms of Dark Others. Most of the time everything&#x2019;s fine ... but when the frenzy comes over you, you won&#x2019;t be able to control yourself. Three or four nights each month. Sometimes more, sometimes less.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;The new moon,&#x2019; the man said with an understanding nod.<br><br>The void laughed again:<br><br>&#x2018;No. Werewolves&#x2019; frenzies aren&#x2019;t linked to the lunar cycle. You&#x2019;d be able to sense the onset of the madness ten or twelve hours before the moment of transformation. But no one can draw up a precise timetable for you.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That won&#x2019;t do,&#x2019; the man said frostily. &#x2018;I repeat my ... request. I wish to become an Other. Not one of the lower Others who are overwhelmed by fits of bestial insanity. Not a Great Magician, involved in great affairs. A perfectly ordinary, rank-and-file Other ... how does that classification of yours go? Seventh-grade?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s impossible,&#x2019; the night replied. &#x2018;You don&#x2019;t have the abilities of an Other. Not even the slightest trace. If you have no musical talent, you can be taught to play the violin. You can become a sportsman, even if you don&#x2019;t have any natural aptitude for it. But you can&#x2019;t become an Other. You&#x2019;re simply a different species. I&#x2019;m very sorry.&#x2019;<br><br>The man on the embankment laughed:<br><br>&#x2018;Nothing is ever impossible. If the lowest form of Other is able to initiate human beings, then there must be some way a man can be turned into a magician.&#x2019;<br><br>The dark night said nothing.<br><br>&#x2018;In any case, I didn&#x2019;t say I wanted to be a Dark Other. I don&#x2019;t have the slightest desire to drink innocent people&#x2019;s blood and go chasing virgins through the fields, or laugh ghoulishly as I lay a curse on someone,&#x2019; the man said testily. &#x2018;I would much rather do good deeds ... and in general, your internal squabbles mean absolutely nothing to me.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That ...&#x2019; the night began wearily.<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s your problem,&#x2019; the man replied. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m giving you one week. And then I want an answer to my request.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Request?&#x2019; the night queried.<br><br>The man on the embankment smiled:<br><br>&#x2018;Yes. So far I&#x2019;m only asking.&#x2019;<br><br>He turned and walked towards his car &#x2014; a Russian Volga, the model that would be back in fashion again in about six months.<br><br><b><br>CHAPTER 1</b><br><br>Even if you love your job, the last day of holiday always makes you feel depressed. Just one week earlier I&#x2019;d been sunning myself on a nice clean Spanish beach, eating paella (to be quite honest, Uzbeki pilaff is better), drinking cold sangria in a little Chinese restaurant (how come the Chinese make the Spanish national drink better than the natives do?) and buying all sorts of rubbishy resort souvenirs in the shops.<br><br>But now it was summer in Moscow again &#x2014; not exactly hot, but stifling and oppressive. And it was that final day of holiday, when you can&#x2019;t get your mind to relax any more, but it flatly refuses to function properly.<br><br>Maybe that was why I was glad when I got the call from Gesar.<br><br>&#x2018;Good morning, Anton,&#x2019; the boss began, without introducing himself. &#x2018;Welcome back. Did you know it was me?&#x2019;<br><br>I&#x2019;d been able to sense Gesar&#x2019;s calls for some time already. It was as if the ringing of the phone changed subtly, becoming more demanding and authoritative.<br><br>But I was in no rush to let the boss know that.<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, Boris Ignatievich.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Are you alone?&#x2019;<br><br>An unnecessary question. I was certain Gesar knew perfectly well where Svetlana was just then.<br><br>&#x2018;Yes. The girls are at the dacha.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Good for them,&#x2019; the boss sighed at the other end of the line, and an entirely human note appeared in his voice. &#x2018;Olga flew off on holiday this morning too ... half the Watch staff are relaxing in southern climes ... Do you think you could call round to the office straight away?&#x2019;<br><br>Before I had time to answer, Gesar went on cheerily.<br><br>&#x2018;Well, that&#x2019;s excellent! See you in forty minutes then.&#x2019;<br><br>I really felt like calling Gesar a cheap poser &#x2014; after I hung up, of course. But I kept my mouth shut. In the first place, the boss could hear what I said without any need of a telephone. And in the second &#x2014; whatever else he might be, he was no cheap poser. He just didn&#x2019;t like wasting time. If I was about to say I&#x2019;d be there in forty minutes, what was the point in listening to me say it?<br><br>And anyway, I was really glad I&#x2019;d got the call. The day was already shot to hell in any case. It was still too early to tidy up the apartment &#x2014; like any self-respecting man whose family is away, I only do that once, on the final day of bachelor life. And I def-initely didn&#x2019;t feel like going round to see anyone or inviting anyone back to my place. So by far the most useful thing would be to go back to work a day early &#x2014; that way, I could ask for time off with a clear conscience when I needed to.<br><br>Even though it wasn&#x2019;t the done thing for us to ask for time off.<br><br>&#x2018;Thanks, boss,&#x2019; I said with real feeling. I detached myself from the armchair, put down the book I hadn&#x2019;t finished, and stretched.<br><br>And then the phone rang again.<br><br>Of course, it would have been just like Gesar to ring and say: &#x2018;You&#x2019;re welcome!&#x2019; But that definitely would have been cheap clowning.<br><br>&#x2018;Hello!&#x2019; I said in a very businesslike tone.<br><br>&#x2018;Anton, it&#x2019;s me.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Sveta,&#x2019; I said, sitting back down again. And suddenly I tensed up &#x2014; Svetlana&#x2019;s voice sounded uneasy. Anxious. &#x2018;Sveta, has something happened to Nadya?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Everything&#x2019;s fine,&#x2019; she replied quickly. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t worry. Why don&#x2019;t you tell me how you&#x2019;ve been getting on?&#x2019;<br><br>I thought for a few seconds. I hadn&#x2019;t had any drinking parties, I hadn&#x2019;t brought any women back home, I wasn&#x2019;t drowning in refuse, I&#x2019;d even been washing the dishes ...<br><br>And then I realised.<br><br>&#x2018;Gesar called. Just a moment ago.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;What does he want?&#x2019; Svetlana asked quickly.<br><br>&#x2018;Nothing special. He asked me to turn up for work today.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Anton, I sensed something. Something bad. Did you agree? Are you going to work?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Why not? I&#x2019;ve got nothing else to do.&#x2019;<br><br>Svetlana was silent. Then she said reluctantly:<br><br>&#x2018;You know, I felt a sort of pricking in my heart. Do you believe I can sense trouble?&#x2019;<br><br>I laughed:<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, Great One.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Anton, be serious, will you!&#x2019; Svetlana was instantly uptight, the way she always got when I called her Great One. &#x2018;Listen to me ... if Gesar asks you to do something, say no.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Sveta, if Gesar called me in, it means he wants to ask me to do something. It means he needs help. He says everyone&#x2019;s on holiday ...&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;He needs more cannon fodder,&#x2019; Svetlana snapped. &#x2018;Anton ... never mind, you won&#x2019;t listen to me anyway. Just be careful.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Sveta, you don&#x2019;t seriously think that Gesar&#x2019;s going to put me in any danger, do you?&#x2019; I said cautiously. &#x2018;I understand the way you feel about him ...&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Be careful,&#x2019; said Svetlana. &#x2018;For our sake. All right?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;All right,&#x2019; I promised. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m always very careful.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll call if I sense anything else,&#x2019; said Svetlana. She seemed to have calmed down a bit. &#x2018;And you call, all right? If anything at all unusual happens, call. Okay?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Okay, I&#x2019;ll call.&#x2019;<br><br>Svetlana paused for a few seconds, then before she hung up, she said:<br><br>&#x2018;You ought to leave the Watch, third-grade Light Magician ...&#x2019;<br><br>It all ended on a suspiciously cheerful note, with a cheap jibe ... Although we had agreed a long time ago not to discuss that subject &#x2014; three years earlier, when Svetlana left the Night Watch. And we hadn&#x2019;t broken our promise once. Of course. I used to tell my wife about my work ... at least, about the jobs that I wanted to remember. And she always listened with interest. But now she had come right out with it.<br>Could she really have sensed something bad?<br><br>Anyway, I got ready to go slowly and reluctantly. I put on a suit, then changed into jeans and a checked shirt, then thought &#x2018;to hell with it!&#x2019; and got into my shorts and a black T-shirt with an inscription that said: &#x2018;My friend was clinically dead, but all he brought me from the next world was this T-shirt!&#x2019; I might look like a German tourist, but at least I would retain the semblance of a holiday mood in front of Gesar.<br><br>Eventually I left the building with just twenty minutes to spare. I had to flag down a car and feel out the probability lines &#x2014; and then tell the driver which streets to take so we wouldn&#x2019;t hit any traffic jams.<br>The driver accepted my instructions hesitantly, he obviously had serious doubts.<br><br>But we got there on time.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>The lifts weren&#x2019;t working &#x2014; there were guys in blue overalls loading them with paper sacks of cement. I set off up the stairs on foot, and discovered that the second floor of our office was being refurbished. There were workmen lining the walls with sheets of plasterboard, and plasterers bustling about beside them, filling in the seams. At the same time they were installing a false ceiling, which already covered the air-conditioning pipes.</p><h2>Celtic Flames</h2><p>Kathie shows us clearly that the early Celtic Christians had an awsome relationship with God. Accounts of the supernatural ministries of Patrick, Brigid, Cuthbert, Brendan, Kieran etc. Read how these Celtic christians in the 4th-5th-6th centuries demonstrated the power of God and won the hearts of the people for the Lord. For example, Patrick converted Dublin by raising the kings two children from the dead. Read this and many other wonderful accounts.</p><p>Kathie Walters was born and raised in England.

In this unique double biography she chronicles their lives - personal and professional, together and apart. John Thaw was born in Manchester, the son of a lorry driver. When he arrived at RADA on a scholarship he felt an outsider. In fact his timing was perfect: it was the sixties and television was beginning to make its mark.

Sheila was already the star of the TV series The Rag Trade and went on to become the first woman artistic director at the RSC. Theirs was a sometimes turbulent, always passionate relationship, and in this remarkable book Sheila describes their love - weathering overwork and the pressures of celebrity, drink and cancer - with honesty and piercing intelligence, and evokes two lives lived to the utmost.</p><p>Sheila Hancock was born in 1933 and attended RADA before embarking on a successful career in acting, both on stage and screen.

It has been the primary vade mecum of Generals, Kings, and Emperors since China&#39;s Warring States period in 5th century BC. Despite its late translation into European languages at the end of the 18th century, Western statesmen and generals were quick to recognize its great worth as a handbook of military strategy, and figures as diverse as Churchill, Napoleon, and General MacArthur praised its genius. The present volume uses the widely lauded 1910 translation of the great British sinologist Lionel Giles. Upon its original publication, it replaced prior translations wholesale, and remains a favourite even today for its faithfulness to the original text and its inimitable classical style.</p><p>Sun Tzu, also known as Sun Wu or Sunzi, was an ancient Chinese military strategist believed to be the author of the acclaimed military text, The Art of War. Details about Sun Tzu s background and life are uncertain, although he is believed to have lived c. 544-496 BCE. Through The Art of War, Sun Tzu s theories and strategies have influenced military leaders and campaigns throughout time, including the samurai of ancient and early-modern Japan, and more recently Ho Chi Minh of the Viet Cong and American generals Norman Swarzkopf, Jr. and Colin Powell during the Persian Gulf War in the 1990s.</p><h2>New Necklaces: 400 Designs in Contemporary Jewellery</h2><p>New Necklaces is the third book curated by jeweler and author Nicolas Estrada.

In 2009, Whispered Words was made into a 13 episode animated television series.Gr 9 Up&#x2014;Best friends Sumika and Ushio have hidden feelings for each other, and because neither wishes to risk their bond, a rift forms between them. At first, Ushio is oblivious to her heart's desire, and Sumika is unwilling to reveal her own feelings, but with new friends complicating their daily lives, they are forced to reevaluate themselves. Gradually, their revelations, coupled with genuine bonding moments, bring them much closer. Character forms morph frequently to visually match the tone of the situation; poignant moments are shaded and highlighted in comparison to the normal gently cute mode, while comedic scenes are simplified and exaggerated. By keeping such elements as happiness and sadness, tension and lightness balanced, the author delivers a well-rounded emotional experience. A few hiccups in the text do not detract from the work. This shoujo-ai (light girls love) is a pure-hearted romance with minimal fanservice that establishes itself as a female friendly environment. Through both characters eyes, readers can feel the affection they have for each other and hope that their feelings can bridge the gap between them. VERDICT A sweet romance between two female teens told in the manga format.&#x2014;Rachel Forbes, Oakville Public Library, Ontario, Canada</p><h2>Cooking Under Pressure (20th Anniversary Edition)</h2><p><p>The 20th Anniversary Edition of the classic cookbook from the leading authority on speed-cooking, <i>Cooking Under Pressure </i>by Lorna Sass offers a mouthwatering array of extraordinary dishes that can be prepared in minutes&#x2014;from classic ossobucco to chocolate cheesecake&#x2014;using a pressure cooker.

It is concerned with minor movements, with the&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cults and manias of that period. Its personages are fanatics, and radicals,&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and mountebanks. Its intention is to connect these secondary movements&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and figures with the primary forces of the century, and to supply a&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background in American history for the Prohibitionists and the Pente�costalists;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the diet-faddists and the dealers in mail-order Personality; the play censors&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Fundamen�talists; the free-lovers and eugenists; the cranks and&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possibly the saints. Sects, cults, manias, movements, fads, religious&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;excitements, and the relation of each of these to the others and to the&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;orderly progress of America are the subject.<br><br>The subject is of course as timely at the beginning of the twenty-first century as when the book first appeared in 1928. Seldes&#x2019;s fascinated and often sympathetic accounts of dreamers, rogues, frauds, sectarians, madmen, and geniuses from Jonathan Edwards to the messianic murderer Matthias have established <i>The Stammering Century</i> not only as a lasting contribution to American history but as a classic in its own right.</p></p><p>Gilbert Seldes (1893&#x2013;1970), the younger brother of famed foreign correspondent and investigative journalist George Seldes, was an influential American journalist, writer, and cultural critic, noted for championing the popular arts. Born into the Jewish agricultural community of Alliance Colony, New Jersey, to philosophical anarchist parents of Russian Jewish descent, he attended Philadelphia&#x2019;s prestigious Central High School and graduated from Harvard University, where he became friends with e. e. cummings and John Dos Passos. After working as a newspaper reporter in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., and as a war correspondent in England during World War I, he joined the staff of <i>The Dial</i> and became the New York correspondent for T. S. Eliot&#x2019;s <i>The Criterion</i>. In 1923, however, he went to Paris to write a book in praise of popular culture. The result, <i>The Seven Lively Arts</i>, appeared the following year to both considerable acclaim and criticism for its celebration of the likes of Al Jolson over John Barrymore and Charlie Chaplin over Cecil B. DeMille. In Paris, Seldes met and married Alice Wadhams Hall; the couple would have two children, Timothy, a literary agent, and Marian, a Tony Award&#x2013;winning actor. Seldes later wrote columns for <i>The Saturday Evening Post </i>and <i>Esquire</i>, adapted <i>Lysistrata</i> and <i>A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream</i> for Broadway, made historical documentary films, wrote radio scripts, and became the first director of television for CBS and the founding dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. His other many books of cultural criticism and social analysis include <i>The Years of the Locust</i> (1932), <i>The Movies Come from America</i> (1937), <i>The Great Audience</i> (1950), and <i>The Public Arts </i>(1956). Seldes also published a novel, <i>The Wings of the Eagle</i> (1929), and, under the name Foster Johns, two books of detective stories.<br><br>Greil Marcus is the author of <i>The Shape of Things to Come: Prophecy and the American Voice</i>, <i>Lipstick Traces</i>, and other books; with Werner Sollors he is the editor of <i>A New Literary History of America</i>. In recent years he has taught at the University of California at Berkeley, Princeton University, the New School University, and the University of Minnesota. He was born in San Francisco and lives in Oakland.&#x201c;One of the most perceptive and entertaining studies of the American spirit in the nineteenth century.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2014;Richard Hofstadter<br><br>&#x201c;The quality of <i>The Stammering Century </i>lay in the fact that its author was interested in the history of his country, not to mock the past or to instruct the present, but for its own sake. Because he was a man of intelligence and sympathy, because his judgment was notably sane and because he worked hard in the sources, his book offered a remarkable picture of the rise and decay of the evangelical strain in American reform....<i>The Stammering Century </i>is a work of continuing vitality and interest.&#x201d; &#x2014;Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He [the reader] will find plenty in to excite his interest and stimulate his reflective powers. He will be continually wondering what is this thing in the mind of man which makes him love impossibilities, and not only believe in them but act on them. Many of Mr. Seldes&#x2019;s moonshine captains are rogues and frauds, but many are honest dreamers, and many are men of incoherent power.&#x201d; <i>&#x2014;The New York Times</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mr. Gilbert Seldes has written a book which I for one have found extraordinarily delightful reading. Dealing as he does with all the cranks of the nineteenth century in America, he might easily have fallen into a tone of hard satire, but throughout he preserves a mood of wistful and whimsical regret....<i>The Stammering Century </i>is not only interesting psychologically and pathetic morally; it is also exceeding amusing, since most or the characters dealt with are delightful absurdities. Being myself inclined to crankdom, I have read the book as an awful warning, but those who have no inclination that way should read it humbly, with the realization that many of the most futile of these saints are authentically of the Kingdom of Heaven.&#x201d; &#x2014;Bertrand Russell</p><h2>Love Color: Choosing colors to live with</h2><p>Choosing colours for your home can become an overwhelming and confusing&nbsp;process&#x2014;there is just so much on offer. <i>Love Colour </i>will help you to bring your&nbsp;favourite colours to life by successfully making all those&nbsp;challenging&nbsp;decisions.

This new gathering of long-unavailable or previously uncollected work presents stories from 1951 to 1971 and shows Gallant's progression from precocious virtuosity, to accomplished artistry, to the expansive innovatory spirit that marks her finest work. <br><br>"Madeleine's Birthday," the first of Gallant's many stories to be published in The New Yorker, pairs off a disaffected teenager, abandoned by her social-climbing mother, with a complacent middle-aged suburban housewife, in a subtly poignant comedy of miscommunication that reveals both characters to be equally adrift. "The Cost of Living," the extraordinary title story, is about a company of strangers, shipwrecked over a chilly winter in a Parisian hotel and bound to one another by animosity as much as by unexpected love. <br><br>Set in Paris, New York, the Riviera, and Montreal and full of scrupulously observed characters ranging from freebooters and malingerers to runaway children and fashion models, Gallant's stories are at once satirical and lyrical, passionate and skeptical, perfectly calibrated and in constant motion, brilliantly capturing the fatal untidiness of life.</p><p><b>Mavis Gallant</b> was born in Montreal and worked as a journalist at the Montreal Standard before moving to Europe to devote herself to writing fiction. After traveling extensively she settled in Paris, where she still resides. She is the recipient of the 2002 Rea Award for the Short Story and the 2004 PEN/Nabokov Award for lifetime achievement. New York Review Books Classics has published two previous collections of Gallant's stories, <i>Paris Stories</i>, selected and introduced by Michael Ondaatje (2002), and <i>Varieties of Exile,</i> selected and introduced by Russell Banks (2003).<br><br><b>Jhumpa Lahiri</b> is the author of the short-story collections <i>Unaccustomed Earth</i> and <i>Interpreter of Maladies</i>, and of a novel, <i>The Namesake</i>. Her interview with Mavis Gallant appeared in the summer 2009 issue of <i>Granta</i>.<p>&#x201c;Often, her fiction drew its energy from contradictory qualities: her stories were minutely observed but also suspenseful, matter-of-fact but also fanciful, reportorial but also imaginative. They were broad-minded, and so felt real...it feels as concrete as anything you might read in the newspaper or see with your own eyes. Gallant had a rare gift: a solid imagination.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New Yorker</i></p><p>"Gallant has, over a long career, deftly documented women on the boundaries between childhood and adulthood, between their native home and their adopted home. As such, it's fitting that the stories in <i>The Cost of Living</i> are mostly strays and tales left out of the 1996 volume <i>The Collected Stories of Mavis Gallant</i>, including her first-ever published piece, 'Madeline's Birthday' from 1951. It's about time they've been brought in from the cold and seated snugly on your bedroom nightstand." --Jessa Crispin, NPR's "Books We Like"</p><p>&#x201c;Mavis Gallant&#x2019;s insights into her characters are achieved with breathtaking economy and rightness of detail. She is a terrifyingly good writer.&#x201d;&#x2014;Margaret Atwood</p><p>&#x201c;[Mavis Gallant&#x2019;s] talent, exercised for many years in Parisian exile, is as versatile and witty as it is somber and empathetic.&#x201d;&#x2014;John Updike</p><p>&#x201c;Gallant&#x2019;s stories relentlessly ask a few unanswerable and essential questions about our bewildering human condition. We come away from her stories with a keener knowledge of ourselves.&#x201d;&#x2014;Alberto Manguel</p><p>"One of the finest practitioners of the short story in the English language." --<i>The New York Times</i></p><p>"One of the great story writers of our time." --Michael Ondaatje</p><p>"The irrefutable master of the short story in English. She is the standout. She is the standard-bearer." --Fran Lebowitz<br><br>&#x201c;One of the most brilliant story writers in the language, who deserves to be read as widely as her fellow Canadian Alice Munro. No one writes about brutish people like Gallant; she transforms the meanest human specimens into subjects of high fascination and sympathy, which makes her excellent reading for overheated festival subway commutes.&#x201d;&nbsp;--Alexandra Schwartz, <i>The New Yorker</i></p></p><h2>The Boleyn King: A Novel (The Boleyn Trilogy)</h2><p><b><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>RT BOOK REVIEWS</i></b><br><br>Perfect for fans of Philippa Gregory, Alison Weir, and Showtime&#x2019;s <i>The Tudors, The Boleyn King</i> is the first book in an enthralling trilogy that dares to imagine: What if Anne Boleyn had actually given Henry VIII a son who grew up to be king?</b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> Just seventeen years old, Henry IX, known as William, is a king bound by the restraints of the regency yet anxious to prove himself.

My history is quickly told--daughter of a French mother and an English gentleman, no siblings, and no parents since I was eight. My full name is Genevieve Antoinette Wyatt. It was Elizabeth who first called me Minuette. I was born more than a month before I was expected, and the first time she saw me, Elizabeth thought me too little for the name my French mother had given me. She attempted to call me Mignonette--meaning dainty and darling--but her three-year-old tongue did not pronounce it properly. I have been Minuette to my friends ever since.<br><br>The importance of this day goes beyond just my seventeenth birthday--today I return to Elizabeth&#x2019;s household after an absence of two years. Queen Anne has been my guardian since my mother&#x2019;s death nearly nine years ago, and I spent my childhood with Elizabeth. But when I turned fifteen, the queen took me into her own household in order to train me properly for Elizabeth&#x2019;s service. I have learnt to stand quietly when necessary, so that I am almost forgotten. I have learnt to remember names and faces, to know the habits of noblemen and the idiosyncrasies of ambassadors. And I have learnt to lock away secrets, for a lady of the privy chamber must be able to keep her own counsel.<br><br>Elizabeth has come to Hampton Court not only to reclaim me but also to join in the weeklong celebrations for William&#x2019;s birthday. There will be feasting and dancing tonight, and I will pretend, as I always have, that the celebrations are half for me. But today the only celebration I truly care about is seeing my friends. Although Queen Anne spends much of her time with her children, I have not seen either of them for a year. Last summer the queen decided I was too dependent on others, and so I was left behind every time she joined the court at Whitehall or Greenwich or Richmond. I spent six months at Hever and six months at Blickling Hall as her resident lady. A great privilege, to be sure--but I would have given up any privilege to see my friends!<br><br>Dominic has come as well. A waiting woman told me that Master Courtenay rode in after dark last night and is even now with the king. I have not seen him for a full sixteen months, not since he was named Lieutenant of the March along the Welsh border. I am sure he could have managed to visit at least once in all that time, but his letters always pleaded duty, a virtue to which he is too much wed. I wonder what he has brought me for my birthday. I hope it is fabric--velvet or satin or shot silk. But it is probably only a book. Dominic has always thought it his calling to teach me to be wise.<br><br>Minuette closed the diary, pristine vellum pages bound by soft calfskin, and marked her place with a bit of burgundy velvet ribbon.<br><br>The sharp, familiar voice of Alyce de Clare came from the open doorway behind her. &#x201c;Are you still here? I was looking forward to having the chamber to myself for once.&#x201d;<br><br>Minuette swiveled on her stool and smiled. &#x201c;You know you will miss me as much as I&#x2019;m going to miss you.&#x201d;<br><br>Alyce was nearly three years older, and she, like Minuette, came from a relatively unimportant family. Alyce had come to Queen Anne because her father had been a secretary in Lord Rochford&#x2019;s household. The queen&#x2019;s brother could be as difficult to please as Anne herself, but both of them were quick to reward loyalty. Alyce&#x2019;s father had served Rochford long and well (and discreetly), and his daughter had been rewarded with a place at court where she might be expected to make a good marriage. She and Minuette had been steady chambermates for the last two years.<br><br>Alyce attempted a smile, but it didn&#x2019;t touch more than the corners of her mouth. &#x201c;You will be too busy being important in Princess Elizabeth&#x2019;s household to remember to miss me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;ll remember.&#x201d; Minuette stood, which meant the shorter Alyce had to look up a little. &#x201c;I just wish . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wish what?&#x201d;<br><br>Minuette hesitated, but she knew that this might be her last chance to speak her worries. &#x201c;Alyce, I&#x2019;m worried about you. I think . . . I think you are in trouble. I would help you if I could.&#x201d;<br><br>Alyce&#x2019;s brown eyes blanked--a skill most women picked up rapidly in the queen&#x2019;s household. On Alyce, it had the effect of sharpening her generous mouth and rounded cheeks, so she looked more like a statue of a woman rather than her usual vivacious, warm self. With distant courtesy, she said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t imagine what you mean.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You should speak to the queen,&#x201d; Minuette said firmly, letting her eyes linger on Alyce&#x2019;s waist. Though still tightly cinched beneath a yellow-and-black-patterned stomacher, it had been growing thicker over the last eight weeks. &#x201c;Someone will tell her soon enough, and you know how she hates gossip.&#x201d;<br><br>For a heartbeat Alyce seemed to teeter on complete denial, then with a rush of emotion she said, &#x201c;And you know very well that the queen will be angry no matter who tells her.&#x201d;<br><br>Minuette did know. But she put a hand on the stiffly embroidered sleeve of Alyce&#x2019;s yellow dress and said gently, &#x201c;You will have to act very soon. If I can help in any way--perhaps I could speak to Elizabeth--&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Alyce jerked away, her waist-length brown hair swirling. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell anyone. Certainly not the princess. She is the very last person who would help me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Elizabeth is my dearest friend, she would--&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Princess Elizabeth is her mother&#x2019;s daughter.&#x201d; Alyce smiled fully this time, a bitter and twisted smile that broke Minuette&#x2019;s heart. &#x201c;The rising star and the setting sun . . . but both of them can burn.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who is the father?&#x201d; Minuette asked quietly. It was a question she had pondered often the last few weeks. One would think that, in the close quarters of the court, she would know whom Alyce had been dallying with. But her friend also knew how to keep secrets.<br><br>Alyce shook her head. &#x201c;You are not meant for these sorts of games, Minuette. You are too trusting and too generous. Those qualities will hurt you one day--but not through any action of mine. Forget what you have guessed. I can take care of myself.&#x201d;<br><br>She turned away with the grace of a sylph and vanished as suddenly as she&#x2019;d come. Minuette sighed, knowing she would hold her tongue, as Alyce had asked. For now.<br><br>Dominic Courtenay fingered the necklace he had bought at the abbey fair in Shrewsbury: cabochon-cut sapphires and pearls to circle the neck, with a filigree star pendant. Neither exotic nor terribly expensive, but Minuette had little jewelry of her own and she delighted in impractical gifts.<br><br>He had just finished tying up the pendant in a square of fabric when William opened the door without knocking and shut it in the faces of those who followed him everywhere. He was dressed for sport, in a linen shirt and leather jerkin.<br><br>&#x201c;Why is it,&#x201d; William said accusingly, &#x201c;that you are the only man in England who keeps me waiting?&#x201d;<br><br>Dominic gave him a wry smile. &#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m the only man in England who still thinks of you as Will rather than as the king.&#x201d;<br><br>William snorted and crossed the room. Picking up a sheet of heavy paper from the desk, he read a few words aloud. &#x201c; &#x2018;Once there were four stars&#x2019; . . . you wrote down the star story for Minuette?&#x201d;<br><br>Dominic pulled the letter away and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not easy to share your birthday with a king, especially not one whose birth was attended by such signs as stars falling from the sky.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a fair enough gift.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What did you get her?&#x201d; Even as he asked, he wondered why it sounded like a challenge.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a surprise. And speaking of gifts . . .&#x201d; William&#x2019;s voice trailed off meaningfully.<br><br>Dominic shook his head. &#x201c;I thought you were anxious for sparring practice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only to prove that my reach is longer than it was when you left--you might find it harder to disarm me.&#x201d;<br><br>Dominic cast a measuring eye over the boy he had known since birth. It was true that he had gone some way to matching his father&#x2019;s height. Still, Dominic was five years older and a natural swordsman. He didn&#x2019;t think William was his equal yet; they would find out soon enough in a fair sparring bout.<br><br>Only once had Dominic made the mistake of going easy. When William was ten and had been king just six months, he and Dominic had spent the morning fighting with wooden practice swords. But William grew impatient with the clumsy replicas and demanded real swords. The swordmaster hesitated, but a nod from Lord Rochford, who was watching their practice, sent him scurrying off.<br><br>William caught the implied permission from the Lord Protector. He said nothing, but Dominic saw the set of his still-childish jaw as they were laced into the bulky, padded jerkins that would be some measure of protection against blunted steel.<br><br>For the first time ever, Dominic allowed himself to make mistakes as they sparred--nothing obvious, or so he thought. Just a misstep here and a delayed feint there, enough to give the younger boy the edge.<br><br>But he had miscalculated. Without warning, William threw his sword straight at Dominic&#x2019;s head. Only a quick duck saved him from being hit squarely by the hilt. Too surprised to move further, Dominic stood silent as William marched up to him, the command in his voice making up for the fact that he was six inches shorter. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you ever do that again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do what?&#x201d; Dominic asked.<br><br>William struck him once, hard on the cheek. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ever lower your guard. I will be the best because I&#x2019;ve earned it. I don&#x2019;t need you to hand me my victories.&#x201d;<br><br>He turned and walked out of the practice arena. He had not raised his voice or lost control of his colour, but Dominic had felt the force of his anger whipping through the air.<br><br>If William&#x2019;s skill had increased as much as his height, he might earn a victory today, and Dominic had just the weapon for him to use. He opened his trunk and removed a layer of neatly folded clothing--plain tunics and jerkins, as befitted a soldier in the field--to uncover the gift that lay beneath.<br><br>There was really no way to make a sword unrecognizable. With a grin of delight, William pulled it free from its scabbard and took a few enthusiastic swings before holding it horizontally in one hand to test the balance.<br><br>Dominic turned the sword so that William could see clearly the four star-shaped gems laid in the gold hilt. &#x201c;Now there&#x2019;s one place where the four of us are always together.&#x201d;<br><br>William laughed. &#x201c;You sound as though you&#x2019;re dying. Or perhaps you&#x2019;ve met an accommodating Welsh miss and wish to change allegiance?&#x201d;<br><br>With a grin, Dominic shrugged off his sentimentality. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be the first to know.&#x201d;<br><br>As she entered her mother&#x2019;s outer chamber, Elizabeth straightened her shoulders, ensuring that the green and gold brocade of her dress did not ripple across the stomacher but flared perfectly from tiny waist to wide skirts. Elizabeth had heard her mother cut a lady to shreds with her tongue for an uneven hem or a slight stain, and she did not doubt that Anne would subject her own daughter to the same.<br><br>A dozen of her mother&#x2019;s ladies were grouped in threes and fours around the ornate presence chamber. Several were working on a tapestry while others wrote letters or talked quietly amongst themselves. One lady, with a straight fall of rich brown hair, played lightly on a lute. As Elizabeth passed her, the young woman looked up and her fingers missed a chord.<br><br>She returned to playing almost at once, but not before giving Elizabeth a hostile glance. What was her name? One of the de Clares, she thought, but not from an important branch or Elizabeth would know her better. Almost she stopped to speak to the woman, but her mother was waiting.<br><br>Queen Anne sat in a gilded wooden chair placed next to a tall window, a Tyndale Bible open on her lap. As Elizabeth curtsied, she wondered how much longer her mother would be able to see the fine print of the books she loved so well. These days she could read only in brightest sunlight.<br><br>Rising with a seductive grace that was still the envy of every woman in England, her mother said, &#x201c;Will you join me within, Elizabeth?&#x201d; Despite the intonation, it was not a question.<br><br>She followed her mother to the door in the north wall that led to the intimate but no less elegant privy chamber. Only one lady of the privy chamber was inside--one who flung herself at Elizabeth in a most inelegant manner.<br><br>&#x201c;Elizabeth!&#x201d;<br><br>Minuette hugged Elizabeth with unrestrained delight while the queen, who would have frozen any other woman with a stare of ice for such behaviour, smiled upon the pair. Beneath her own delight, Elizabeth felt a brief spasm of pain. Minuette had always had charm--not the studied, showy type, but natural as breath and as much a part of her as her honey-coloured hair. Elizabeth could clearly remember her father visiting the schoolroom in the year before his death. She had spent an hour translating Latin and Greek for him, doing mathematics, and discussing theology. Though he&#x2019;d complimented Elizabeth&#x2019;s mind, it was nine-year-old Minuette who had disarmed him. When the formidable, enormous King Henry had left, it had been Minuette whom he&#x2019;d hugged goodbye.<br><br>Elizabeth might have hated her for that charm, if Minuette weren&#x2019;t so utterly without guile.<br><br>Queen Anne&#x2019;s beautiful voice broke into Elizabeth&#x2019;s memory. &#x201c;I take it that you are both pleased.&#x201d;<br><br>Beneath the words lay a hint of perplexity, as though she could not imagine why. Truthfully, Elizabeth would have been hard-pressed to name a single woman whom her mother considered a friend. She had always preferred men.<br><br>Feeling almost sorry for her mother, Elizabeth said, &#x201c;I could not be more pleased. It is generous of you to allow her to return to my household.&#x201d;<br><br>Her mother might like flattery, but she was never stupid. &#x201c;Considering that you have been pressing the king for months, you cannot be surprised. She is a trifle young still--as are you, Elizabeth.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will be twenty in September,&#x201d; Elizabeth said mildly.<br><br>As if she hadn&#x2019;t heard, her mother went on, &#x201c;But your brother is determined to allow you an unusual measure of independence.&#x201d;<br><br>It was Minuette, naturally, who had something complimentary to say. &#x201c;And how could he do otherwise, with the example of his great father before him? Did not King Henry give you the right of femme sole over the objections of his council?&#x201d;</p><h2>Limits of Power (Paladin&#39;s Legacy)</h2><p>Elizabeth Moon is back with the fourth adventure in her bestselling fantasy epic. Moon brilliantly weaves a colorful tapestry of action, betrayal, love, and magic set in a richly imagined world that stands alongside those of such fantasy masters as George R. R. Martin and Robin Hobb.<br> &nbsp;<br> The unthinkable has occurred in the kingdom of Lyonya. The queen of the Elves&#x2014;known as the Lady&#x2014;is dead, murdered by former elves twisted by dark powers. Now the Lady&#x2019;s half-elven grandson must heal the mistrust between elf and human before their enemies strike again. Yet as he struggles to make ready for an attack, an even greater threat looms across the Eight Kingdoms.<br> &nbsp;<br> Throughout the north, magic is reappearing after centuries of absence, emerging without warning in family after family&#x2014;rich and poor alike. In some areas, the religious strictures against magery remain in place, and fanatical followers are stamping out magery by killing whoever displays the merest sign of it&#x2014;even children. And as unrest spreads, one very determined traitor works to undo any effort at peace&#x2014;no matter how many lives it costs. With the future hanging in the balance, it is only the dedication of a few resolute heroes who can turn the tides . . . if they can survive.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Limits of Power</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s easy to become fully immersed in, and absorbed by, the narrative: [Moon&#x2019;s] great strength lies in the patient accumulation of telling detail, yielding an extraordinarily rich picture of the world&#x2019;s politics, philosophy, military structure, history, magic and alien cultures, where men and women stand as equals even in force of arms.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Thoughtful and deeply character driven, full of personal crises as heartbreaking and hopeful as any dramatic invasion . . .

You killed her!&#x201d;<br><br>The angry voices penetrated Kieri&#x2019;s grief and exhaustion, and he looked back over his shoulder to see at least a dozen elves, some with swords drawn, his uncle Amrothlin among them. Behind them, more Squires pushed into the room.<br><br>&#x201c;I did not,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I tried&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s dead! You&#x2019;re alive; you must have&#x2014;!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I tried to save her,&#x201d; Kieri said. &#x201c;I could not.&#x201d; He stood up then, automatically collecting his weapons as he rose.<br><br>&#x201c;Let me see that!&#x201d; Amrothlin strode forward, pointing at Kieri&#x2019;s sword. &#x201c;If it has her blood on it&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course it does,&#x201d; Kieri said. &#x201c;You saw: my sword lay in her blood, there on the floor.&#x201d; He had knelt in her blood, he realized, and his hands were stained. No wonder Amrothlin suspected him, though the blood that spattered his clothes had come from others.<br><br>Amrothlin reached out his hand. &#x201c;Let me smell it. I know her scent; I will know another&#x2019;s scent, if indeed another&#x2019;s blood is there. Give it to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Arian said before Kieri could answer, blocking Amrothlin with her arm. &#x201c;You will not disarm the king,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Not after what has happened.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You!&#x201d; Amrothlin glared at her. &#x201c;You half-bred troublemaker, child of one who should never have sired children on mortals&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Daughter of one who gave his life to save the Lady,&#x201d; Arian said. Kieri saw the glitter of both tears and anger in her eyes. &#x201c;There he lies, and you would insult him?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you know you cannot hold this sword,&#x201d; Kieri said, forcing a calm tone through the anger he felt. How dare Amrothlin insult Arian&#x2014;and where had he been all this time? Was he the traitor? &#x201c;You remember: it&#x2019;s sealed to me. Smell if you wish, but do not touch it.&#x201d;<br><br>Amrothlin glared at them all, then fixed his gaze on Arian. &#x201c;What should I think when I find three mortals around my Lady&#x2019;s body with swords drawn and her blood run out like water from a cracked jug? I see no other foe here. It is you, I say, and this&#x2014;this so-called king.&#x201d;<br><br>Kieri glanced past Amrothlin. The ring of elves stood tense; behind them were Squires who hesitated to push them aside, and behind those the hooded figures of two Kuakkgani. He met Amrothlin&#x2019;s angry gaze once more.<br><br>&#x201c;I am the king,&#x201d; he said, keeping his voice as steady as he could. &#x201c;I am the king, and my mother was your sister, and this Lady was my grandmother. So we are kin, whether you like it or not. If you can indeed detect identity by the smell of the blood, then you will smell another immortal&#x2019;s blood on this&#x2014;and on the queen&#x2019;s sword and Duke Verrakai&#x2019;s as well.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you dare accuse an elf?&#x201d; Amrothlin asked. He still trembled like a candle flame, but his voice had calmed.<br><br>&#x201c;The one who did this could appear without walking through a door. Its mien seemed elven at first and also its magery, a glamour of the same sort as the Lady was wont to cast. Yet it was like no elf I have known in its malice and determination to kill the Lady. I believe you name such iynisin; in Tsaia we called them kuaknomi.&#x201d;<br><br>Amrothlin glared. &#x201c;We do not speak of them.&#x201d; He looked over his shoulder, then back to Kieri. &#x201c;Who was here at the time?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Later,&#x201d; Kieri said. Voices rose in the corridor: angry, frightened, demanding. Time to take command. &#x201c;Uncle, this is not the time for questions. I am the king, and I am not your enemy, nor the Lady&#x2019;s. People are frightened; I must speak to them.&#x201d;<br><br>Before Amrothlin could answer, he raised his voice and called to those beyond the room. &#x201c;The danger is over for now: I, the king, am alive, and the queen is safe here with me. Those of you in the corridor: fetch the palace physicians for the wounded. The rest disperse, but for the Queen&#x2019;s Squires assigned to the queen today and one Kuakgan. Put by your swords.&#x201d; The elves by the door looked at Amrothlin, who said nothing, and then at Kieri again and finally put up their swords. Two Queen&#x2019;s Squires made their way into the room and edged through the elves to Arian&#x2019;s side.<br><br>Dorrin had already moved to one of the wounded Squires. &#x201c;This one first, sir king. Both are sore wounded, and though I tried, I cannot heal them.&#x201d;<br><br>Kieri knelt beside her. When he laid his hand on the man&#x2019;s shoulder, he felt nothing but a heaviness. &#x201c;Nor I,&#x201d; he said, standing again. &#x201c;I must be more worn than I thought.&#x201d;<br><br>The noise outside diminished. &#x201c;I will tell the whole of it to Amrothlin,&#x201d; Kieri said to the elves. &#x201c;Two may remain; the rest of you go and make what preparations you need make for the Lady&#x2019;s rest.&#x201d; He knelt beside the other Squire yet felt no healing power in himself. Sighing, he stood again.<br><br>Amrothlin&#x2019;s stony expression did not change, but he did not contradict Kieri; with a wave of his hand he sent most of the elves away. Now the carnage showed more clearly&#x2014;the pools of blood, the stench of blood and death, bloody footprints on the fine carpet, what looked like scorch marks, the dead: the Lady, Dameroth, another dead elf whose name Kieri did not know, Tolmaric&#x2019;s twisted and shrunken body, and the two iynisin Kieri and Arian and Dorrin had killed. Arian&#x2019;s clothes were as bloodstained as his own, and Dorrin, though she had not knelt in any blood, still had splashes on her shirt and sword hand.<br><br>&#x201c;More dead elves,&#x201d; one of the other elves said, bending to examine them. Then he stiffened, turning back to Amrothlin. &#x201c;My lord! These are not elves! They are . . . what the king said.&#x201d;<br><br>Amrothlin, still looking at Kieri, said, &#x201c;Is this what you fought? Did you kill it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That is another it split from its body after it killed Sier Tolmaric,&#x201d; Kieri said. &#x201c;Look at Tolmaric, look at its body, and if you can explain how that was done, I will be glad.&#x201d;<br><br>Amrothlin turned and walked over to Tolmaric&#x2019;s remains. &#x201c;This was human?&#x201d; He sounded more worried than angry now.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. The iynisin did that with a touch of its blade to his throat. He was already bespelled by the Lady, as I said, and helpless.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where were you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There.&#x201d; Kieri pointed. He told of questioning Sier Tolmaric, the Lady&#x2019;s interruption, and then the appearance of the iynisin&#x2014;he insisted on using the name, though Amrothlin flinched every time&#x2014;and its taunting of the Lady and attack. &#x201c;I had just taken such a blow on my shoulder as almost threw me down. It was almost invisible; I could not see to parry the blow&#x2014;and then it made for poor Tolmaric and did that to him, whatever that is. Then from the iynisin came two more, and each of those split into two.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A formidable foe indeed,&#x201d; Amrothlin said. &#x201c;Few of . . . such . . . can do that, and only with fresh blood and life taken.&#x201d; He moved over beside the elf looking at the other body. Kieri saw his shoulders stiffen. Amrothlin crouched beside the body and touched the blood staining its dark clothes, then sniffed at his fingers. He stood and faced Kieri again. &#x201c;You brought this on us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; That accusation made no sense to him.<br><br>&#x201c;You could not survive such a one unless it willed it so. The&#x2014;these beings&#x2014;&#x201d; Even now Amrothlin would not use the word. &#x201c;You know their origin? Traitors who once were elves, in the morning of the world, and who turned against all because of those.&#x201d; He pointed at the Kuakgan now standing near the door. &#x201c;You called Kuakkgani here; that must be why the evil ones came. We do not speak of them. We do not acknowledge them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And yet these iynisin exist,&#x201d; Kieri said, once more using the elven name for them. &#x201c;And they&#x2014;or one&#x2014;killed the Lady. Are all of them that powerful?&#x201d; This, he was certain, was one of the secrets the elves had withheld from him; how could they think that not speaking of danger meant it did not exist?<br><br>&#x201c;So you say, that she was killed by such.&#x201d; Amrothlin made an obvious attempt to calm down, but did not answer Kieri&#x2019;s question. He sniffed his fingers again. &#x201c;It is more likely a lord of the Severance could kill her than a half-human like you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;These dead are certainly ephemes, split from such a one. And that&#x2014;&#x201d; He glanced at Tolmaric&#x2019;s remains. &#x201c;That is what any living thing looks like that they destroy to make ephemes.&#x201d; He nodded to Kieri, now apparently calm. &#x201c;I accept your story of the fight, but still&#x2014;it is your fault that the Lady came here unescorted and such evil followed her. You knew what she thought of the . . . the Kuakkgani.&#x201d; He nearly spat the last word, his voice full of venom again.<br><br>&#x201c;What I see is that you are determined to blame the king,&#x201d; Arian said. Kieri had never seen her so angry before. Flanked by her Squires, she stalked over to him. &#x201c;Where were you when I was poisoned and my child never had a chance to live? The Lady did not come. None of you came. It was a Kuakgan who found the poison concealed in a block of spice: you elves did nothing. And you blame us for that?&#x201d;<br><br>Amrothlin stared at her, speechless in the face of her anger.<br><br>&#x201c;So now,&#x201d; Kieri said, taking over once more, &#x201c;let us clean up this mess and confer.&#x201d; The palace physicians bustled into the room; he pointed to Binir and Curn, the two wounded Squires. Linne, another of the King&#x2019;s Squires, handed him cleaning materials for his sword; he began wiping it down. Arian handed her blade to one of her Squires. &#x201c;Who is now the ruler of the elvenhome?&#x201d; Kieri asked Amrothlin. &#x201c;Will it be you, her son, or had she named another in her stead?&#x201d;<br><br>Amrothlin shook his head. &#x201c;There is no elvenhome.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2014;? Of course there is . . . must be.&#x201d; At the look on Amrothlin&#x2019;s face, Kieri said, &#x201c;How can it be gone?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you not see?&#x201d; Amrothlin gestured to his own grief-stricken face. &#x201c;Do I look the same? Do you feel the influence of the elvenhome? It was hers&#x2014;her creation&#x2014;and it died with her. She alone sustained the Ladysforest; she had no heir. We are unhomed, Nephew. We are cast away, and nowhere in the world will we find a home now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That cannot be. The taig is still here.&#x201d; Kieri could feel the taig, the strength of it, even in its grief.<br><br>&#x201c;The taig, yes. It is the spirit of all life. Where there is life, there is taig, greater and smaller. The taig nourishes elvenkind, and elvenkind nourishes the taig. We encouraged it, taught it, lifted it toward more awareness, according to the Lady&#x2019;s design. But it is not the elvenhome.&#x201d;<br><br>This was the longest explanation Kieri had ever heard about the relationship of elves and taig. &#x201c;Then what is an elvenhome? Did the Lady then maintain the elvenhome with her own power? By herself?&#x201d; And if so, how could such a power be stripped away?<br><br>&#x201c;At first, yes,&#x201d; Amrothlin said. &#x201c;But after we left the great hall below, in the time of the banast taig . . .&#x201d; His voice trailed away; he looked down and away. &#x201c;I cannot talk of it now, Nephew, please. Her power diminished, and now she is gone; the elfane taig is gone; I must prepare to lay her body to rest.&#x201d;<br><br>Kieri felt tears rising in his eyes and blinked them back. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you ever tell me? Why didn&#x2019;t Orlith? If I had known&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You would have tried to interfere,&#x201d; Amrothlin said, his voice harsh again. &#x201c;And what could you, a mortal, do? You had no power to lend us. You could but cause the Lady more anguish, to know that you knew her shame.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And this is better?&#x201d; Kieri asked. The familiar irritation with elven arrogance overrode even his fatigue. He waved at the room, at the bodies and the blood and the stench of death. &#x201c;Her pride cost you dear, Uncle. You were so sure we could not help, you did not even seek understanding, let alone alliance&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How could such as you understand?&#x201d; Amrothlin said. He looked more weary than angry now, his grace diminished. &#x201c;What we live&#x2014;what she lived&#x2014;is beyond your comprehension. It is no use to explain; you do not have the mind for it.&#x201d;<br><br>Kieri&#x2019;s anger grew, but he knew that for a postbattle reaction as much as a fair response to Amrothlin. He glanced around the room. Everyone but the physicians working on the wounded Squires was looking at him. This was not the time to continue a quarrel with Amrothlin.<br><br>&#x201c;Are any others wounded and in need of care?&#x201d; No one answered. Arian&#x2019;s Squire returned her blade, now cleaned, and Arian slid it into the scabbard. Kieri had almost finished with his own.<br><br>&#x201c;We will need to make a bier to move her,&#x201d; Amrothlin said. &#x201c;And . . . and the others.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is there any menace in Sier Tolmaric&#x2019;s remains?&#x201d; Kieri asked.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Amrothlin said. &#x201c;The evil destroyed him but does not remain. Do what you will with . . . that.&#x201d; He gestured toward Tolmaric&#x2019;s body but averted his gaze. &#x201c;But beware the iynisin ephemes. Even their blood taints anything alive or that once lived. You must burn such things in a safe place away from here.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Politics of Ecstasy (Leary, Timothy)</h2><p>Writings that sparkle with the psychedelic revolution.

Timothy Radcliffe argues we must show how everything we believe is an invitation to live fully. God says: "I put before you life and death: choose life."</p><p>Anyone who understands the beauty and messiness of human life--novelists, poets, filmmakers and so on--can be our allies, whether they believe or not. The challenge is not today's secularism but its banality.<br>We accompany the disciples as they struggle to understand this strange man who heals, casts out demons and offers endless forgiveness. In the face of death, he teaches them what it means to be alive in God. Then he embraces all that afflicts and crushes humanity. Finally, Radcliffe explores what it means for us to be alive spiritually, physically, sacramentally, justly and prayerfully. The result is a compelling new understanding of the words of Jesus: "I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."</p></p><p><b>Timothy Radcliffe</b> is a former Master of the Dominican Order in Rome.

In an era of increasing fears about mental deterioration, world-renowned neuropsychologist Elkhonon Goldberg provides startling new evidence that though the brain diminishes in some tasks as it ages, it gains in many ways. Most notably, it increases in what he terms &#x201c;wisdom&#x201d;: the ability to draw upon knowledge and experience gained over a lifetime to make quick and effective decisions. Goldberg delves into the machinery of the mind, separating memory into two distinct types: singular (knowledge of a particular incident or fact) and generic (recognition of broader patterns). As the brain ages, the ability to use singular memory declines, but generic memory is unaffected&#x2014;and its importance grows. As an individual accumulates generic memory, the brain can increasingly rely upon these stored patterns to solve problems effortlessly and instantaneously. Goldberg investigates the neurobiology of wisdom, and draws on historical examples of artists and leaders whose greatest achievements were realized late in life.</p><p><b>Praise for <i>The Wisdom Paradox:</i></b><br> "Impressive. . .

In <i>Stillness</i>, he clarifies the three fundamental types of cranial work - biomechanical, functional, and biodynamic - as defined by cranial osteopathy. He explains the requirements and pitfalls of each model, and how to discern the differences and similarities between them. He guides the practitioner experientially to explore what he is describing and offers exercises drawn from his own practice to help therapists access directly the whole felt-body sense that connects each individual with the Breath of Life.</p><p>In <i>Stillness</i>, I characterize the felt-sense <i>inside</i> a practitioner while practicing one of the three types of cranial work.&nbsp; My emphasis on a biodynamic cranial practice for the evolution of consciousness is because there is so much confusion about biodynamics than there is with functional or biomechanical cranial work. The confusion is perpetrated by the craniosacral biodynamics institutions that mix the types of cranial work and call it craniosacral biodynamics.&nbsp;<br><br>In hindsight, I realize that in <i>Stillness</i> I did not go far enough&nbsp;because the confusion has grown cancer-like in the biodynamic cranial field.

She lives in Ithaca, New York.Fresh and most likable nature essays, first seen in The New Yorker in different versions. Ackerman (A Natural History of the Senses, 1990, etc.) sits at dusk in Mexico at the mouth of a cave. In a moment, 20 million bats will rise and fly to their night's feeding. At her side is Merlin Tuttle, founder of Bat Conservation International (``I could probably raise ten times as much money if I promised people I'd get rid of all the bats in their area...''). Ackerman jeeps across Texas's Big Bend with him as he photographs bats and speaks of such species as the tube-nosed fruit bat, whose elongated nostrils look like party favors. He explains how bats are essential in the life-histories of avocados, bananas, dates, figs, peaches, and tequila. Nevertheless, they are systematically exterminated; Australia's government, for example, has managed to kill 99% of their flying foxes (a large bat with a foxlike face). Ackerman next visits a gator farm in St. Augustine, where she helps determine the reptiles' sex by putting her finger in their cloaca--a cavity in which the sex organs lie. Discovering that females have a clitoris, she asks, ``Does this mean that they can have an orgasm?'' But nobody knows--she's reached the limits of science. Flying to Maui, she is the guest of Roger Payne, the world's most faithful recorder of humpback whale songs. From him she learns that there are 35 known singers, and that the music is quite complex at first listen, but becomes monotonous over a season: all whales sing the same song, which evolves slowly year to year. Ackerman's evocation of a whale song shows her agile descriptive power: ``Then a trumpeting sound...surged into a two- stage grunt...followed by a stuttering lawn mower that changed from a finger being drawn across a taut balloon, then a suite of basso groans and a badly oiled garden gate creaking open.'' A choice treat for both nature lovers and general readers. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Blissfully living a life of French decadence, Sandy maneuvers between coups, spies, bombings, corruption, and scandal as she and her thirteen-year-old brother, Tom, run an illicit baby powder and Hershey bar business on the black market and live a life of school, scouts, dance parties, and movies at the underground theater.<br> <br> When the Colonel&#x2019;s counterpart, Colonel Le Van Sam, delivers an expose on the current ruling Diem regime, Sandy finds that her constant spying on her father&#x2019;s activities has brought her face to face with the reality of Vietnam and the anti-American sentiment that pervades it. This coming-of age story takes place in a turbulent country striving for nationalism, giving the reader a stunning look into the life of military dependents living abroad and the underlying ignorance that surrounded a little understood time in history.</p><p>A resident of New York City and Lambertville, New Jersey, Sandy Hanna grew up in Saigon, South Vietnam and has been telling her story about that experience all of her life.

He fell into the life of a sugar plantation owner by mere chance, but by the time he harvested his first crop, a revolution was fully under way: the farming of sugar cane, and the swiftly increasing demands for sugar worldwide, would not only lift George Ashby from abject poverty and shape the lives of his descendants, but it would also bind together ambitious white entrepreneurs and enslaved black workers in a strangling embrace. Stuart uses her own family story&#x2014;from the seventeenth century through the present&#x2014;as the pivot for this epic tale of migration, settlement, survival, slavery and the making of the Americas.<br><br> As it grew, the sugar trade enriched Europe as never before, financing the Industrial Revolution and fuelling the Enlightenment. And, as well, it became the basis of many economies in South America, played an important part in the evolution of the United States as a world power and transformed the Caribbean into an archipelago of riches. But this sweet and hugely profitable trade&#x2014;&#x201c;white gold,&#x201d; as it was known&#x2014;had profoundly less palatable consequences in its precipitation of the enslavement of Africans to work the fields on the islands and, ultimately, throughout the American continents. Interspersing the tectonic shifts of colonial history with her family&#x2019;s experience, Stuart explores the interconnected themes of settlement, sugar and slavery with extraordinary subtlety and sensitivity. In examining how these forces shaped her own family&#x2014;its genealogy, intimate relationships, circumstances of birth, varying hues of skin&#x2014;she illuminates how her family, among millions of others like it, in turn transformed the society in which they lived, and how that interchange continues to this day. Shifting between personal and global history, Stuart gives us a deepened understanding of the connections between continents, between black and white, between men and women, between the free and the enslaved. It is a story brought to life with riveting and unparalleled immediacy, a story of fundamental importance to the making of our world.</p><p><p>Andrea Stuart was born and raised in the Caribbean. She studied English at the University of East Anglia and French at the Sorbonne. Her book <i>The Rose of</i> <i>Martinique: A Life of Napoleon&#x2019;s Josephine</i> was published in the United States in 2004, has been translated into three languages and won the Enid McLeod Literary Prize. Stuart&#x2019;s work has been published in numerous anthologies, newspapers and magazines, and she regularly reviews books for <i>The Independent</i>. She has also worked as a TV producer.</p>1<br><br>There was a wind over England, and it blew.<br><br>(Have you heard the news of Virginia?)<br><br>A west wind blowing, the wind of a western star,<br><br>To gather men&#x2019;s lives like pollen and cast them forth,<br><br>Blowing in hedge and highway and seaport town,<br><br>Whirling dead leaf and living but always blowing,<br><br>A salt wind, a sea wind, a wind from the world&#x2019;s end,<br><br>From the coasts that have new wild names, from the huge unknown.<br><br>&#x2014;stephen vincent ben�t, &#x201c;western star&#x201d;<br><br>george ashby&#x2019;s story began as all migrants&#x2019; stories do: with a journey.<br><br>Some time in the late 1630s, when George Ashby was finally given notification that his ship was ready to sail, he must have been afraid. He was a blacksmith, a young man in his late teens, about to leave behind everything he had ever known. Though the voyage carried the seeds of his dreams he, like most of the population, had probably never undergone a long sea journey before and had no real idea of what to expect when he arrived in the Americas.<br><br>Those who chose to undertake the fearsome Atlantic crossing in search of a new life were generally tough&#x2014;or else dangerously foolish. But what else can we know about George Ashby, my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather? Was he fleeing from a family or seeking a new one? Did he dream of religious freedom or of wealth? Was he ambivalent about leaving his homeland or were his life experiences so bitter that he believed nothing in the Americas could be worse? As he set sail for the adventuresome world of the Caribbean he would have had no idea how heavily the odds were stacked against him. (According to one historian, men like him were &#x201c;pursuing a will-o&#x2019;-the-wisp,&#x201d; since very few of them ever achieved the better life they longed for.) He could not know that he would be one of the lucky ones: that he would not just survive but found a dynasty that endures to this day, built on sugar and forged by slavery.<br><br>The first sight of the ship would have done nothing to allay his trepidation. The typical merchant vessel that plied the route between the Caribbean and Britain was rated at around 200 tons (meaning that it could accommodate 200 casks or tuns of wine). Trussed against the stone walls of the dock, the ship looked like a gigantic gutted carcass afloat upon the water. The gaunt ribs of the wooden hull curved menacingly into the sky and the base was coated with a shaggy pelt of seaweed and barnacles. It would have been hard for George to countenance that he would be confined in the belly of this behemoth for almost two months, with the real possibility that his journey would end, like that of so many before him, in massacre by pirates or drowning at sea.<br><br>After unpacking and settling in, the passengers were summoned on deck to present their documents to the &#x201c;searchers.&#x201d; These officials administered the oath of allegiance to the king, stamped each traveller&#x2019;s ticket with the crucial &#x201c;Licences under their hands and seals to pass the seas,&#x201d; and then cleared the vessel for departure. Since every passenger had to undergo this process, no matter what their individual circumstances or where they came from, it represented their first rite of passage, one that made their new status as migrants starkly real.<br><br>Still gathered on the bridge, the passengers chatted among themselves or waved to family and friends gathered portside to wish them bon voyage. Then, all of a sudden, a flurry of activity: the sailors scrambling across the deck, busying themselves with a series of tasks that were inexplicable to most of the passengers, the screeching of the anchor as it was winched aboard, the screaming of the hoisted sails, the shouting of the master and the sailors, all combined in a violent auditory assault. As the crew worked furiously in the bows, stern and dock, the passengers jostled to be as near the rails as possible.<br><br>Despite the noise and bustle of the ship, most of the migrants would have been as hushed as worshippers in a church, fearful of what the voyage might hold or trying to imagine what lay at the other end. They were aware that the journey was, in all probability, final. Some may have dreamt of returning to their homeland enriched, perhaps even ennobled, but most rightly sensed that they would not be coming back.<br><br>To truly grasp what this sea journey meant, what bravery and audacity it required, one must understand how the world was seen and known at that time. Though George Ashby and his contemporaries had been born in the Age of Discovery (1500&#x2013;1700), most of the world was still terra incognita for Europeans. Maps were often sketchy and inaccurate. Two continents, Australia and Antarctica, had not been traced at all, and vast areas were still blank. The interiors of South America, Africa and Asia had scarcely been explored. Beyond the eastern fringe of North America, which George&#x2019;s fellow pioneers had begun to document, were millions of square miles of uncharted wilderness.<br><br>Like many other countries in the Old World, England was poised between the medieval and the modern, where most people&#x2019;s lives played out within a narrow radius around their birthplace, and their beliefs were characterized by superstition and ignorance. It was an age in which magic still played a large part in the lives of ordinary people and many firmly believed in witches and fairies, that butterflies were the souls of the dearly departed, and that churchyards swarmed with souls and spirits. In the absence of real information about far-off lands, fantasies abounded: that the east was populated with dog-headed men and basilisks, that Africa had tribes with no heads at all&#x2014;just eyes and mouths in their breasts&#x2014;and that the Caribbean was peopled by cannibals, amazons and giants. Some believed that the oceans were full of strange creatures such as mermaids and sea dragons. In 1583 Sir Henry Gilbert professed to have encountered a lion-like sea monster on his return from claiming St. John&#x2019;s, Newfoundland, for England. In a world that was as yet so immeasurable, frightening and inexplicable, George and his fellow travellers must have feared that they were not just crossing the map, but falling off the edge of it.<br><br>Yet by the seventeenth century, many thousands of Britons, beguiled by the much-vaunted possibilities of the &#x201c;New World&#x201d; (which they saw as a tabula rasa on which they could write, despite the long history and complex cultures long implanted there), were willing to take that leap into the unknown, and left their homeland to start a fresh life in the Americas. The migration had begun as a trickle in 1607 with the settling of Jamestown, the first permanent colony in what is now the United States. It had increased to a recognizable stream by 1629 and became a veritable flood in the 1640s, when over 100,000 people left a country with a population of just under five million. (Between 1600 and 1700 over 700,000 people emigrated from England, about 17 per cent of the English population in 1600.) At the rate of one ship departing from England every day, these pioneers arrived to &#x201c;settle the Americas,&#x201d; fanning out from Newfoundland for three thousand miles, via Virginia and the Caribbean, to Guiana on the South American mainland. All the way they fought, worked and died to establish themselves in new and terrifying lands.<br><br>The English weren&#x2019;t the only nation on the move. The Spanish were the pioneers of colonization of the Americas, and the Portuguese, French and Dutch swiftly became essential players in the region. But just over a century after Christopher Columbus&#x2019;s discovery of the New World (which the historian Germ�n Arciniegas described as being &#x201c;so momentous a development in human history that it was like the passing from the third to the fourth day in the first chapter of Genesis&#x201d;), it was the small nation of England that emerged as Europe&#x2019;s greatest colonizing power. This was particularly surprising for a people who were &#x201c;wedded to their native Soile like a Snaile to his shell.&#x201d; What motivated these patriotic and insular people to abandon the world as they knew it and move halfway across the globe?<br><br>The why of George Ashby&#x2019;s departure is something I will never know; my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather was most likely typical of the men who settled much of the New World, a man of action, not reflection, who did not take time out to write letters or keep journals; nor was he important enough for others to write about him. But certainly some of the wider reasons that stirred migrants to risk the New World would have applied to him. Historians have summarized Europe&#x2019;s motivation for the conquest of the Americas with the pithy phrase &#x201c;God, gold and glory.&#x201d; This formula is slightly reductive&#x2014;and certainly doesn&#x2019;t allow for the large number of migrants who had no say in their transfer&#x2014;but it does convey the positive pull of the opportunities represented by the New World.<br><br>It was not only the much-persecuted Puritans who went to settle New England for whom God was important. The vast majority of those who migrated to colonies south of Maryland were what the historian Carl Bridenbaugh has dubbed &#x201c;non-separating puritans.&#x201d; They may not have moved together as a religious community led by a minister, but they did share the Puritans&#x2019; profound unease with the old ways of worship and were questioning of the ancient, ceremonial doctrines of the established church. They too had looked on at the risible spectacle of &#x201c;the typical Sunday service in England, where parishioners stared dumbly at a minister mumbling incomprehensible phrases from the Book of Common Prayer&#x201d; and recognized &#x201c;how far most people were from a true engagement with the word of God.&#x201d; So while they had not been impassioned enough to make their faith the prime motivation for their migration, their religious leanings meant that they were that bit more likely to be disillusioned&#x2014;and therefore to contemplate migration&#x2014;than their fellow Englishmen.<br><br>The Bible was, in fact, a potent recruiter for colonization. In an age where the scriptures permeated everyday life, there were numerous passages that would have resonated with those tempted by the &#x201c;Western Star.&#x201d; Great orators such as the Anglican priest Robert Gray, or John Donne, the Dean of St. Paul&#x2019;s, or the Puritan preachers Thomas Hooker and John Cotton thundered from Genesis: &#x201c;Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father&#x2019;s house, unto a land that I will shew thee: And I will make of thee a great nation,&#x201d; or from II Samuel 7:10: &#x201c;I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more: neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime.&#x201d;<br><br>The dream of building a City on the Hill for the perfection of the human spirit, so inspirational to the Puritans, was also an attractive one for many other migrants, as was the entire project of spreading the word. Captain John Smith, the era&#x2019;s most famous adventurer turned planter, declared:<br><br>If hee have any graine of faith or zeale in Religion, what can he doe less hurtfull to any, or more agreeable to God, then to seeke to convert those poore Savages to know Christ and humanity, whose labours with discretion will triple requite thy charge and paine; what so truly sutes with honour and honesty, as the discovering things unknowne, erecting Townes, peopling Countries, informing the ignorant, reforming things unjust, teaching vertue and gaine to our native mother Country a Kingdome to attend her.<br><br>But rhetoric about taking Christianity and civilization to the heathen (so lavishly exploited by the Spanish conquistadors), or giving European creativity and imagination space to grow, was a smokescreen for the economic imperatives that drove the majority of migrants. They hungered for gold; or at least the chance to acquire land, their own little piece of paradise.<br><br>Most seventeenth-century English �migr�s were in flight from terrible poverty. In the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, rapid population growth and periodic agricultural depression, culminating in a series of terrible famines, caused genuine hardship. In the countryside large numbers of people had been deprived of their ancient rural security. The lack of land to cultivate frustrated many, while unemployment threatened agricultural labourers as well as village artisans. The rise in the cost of living and the simultaneous fall in the value of wages meant that many people were surviving on the very margins of existence. Housing was inadequate at best; in cold or wet weather fuel was scarce and expensive. Health scares were frequent, with regular outbreaks of tuberculosis and plague. Effective medical treatment was almost non-existent and so the mortality rate&#x2014;already high&#x2014;rose even higher.<br><br>Resentment against these conditions focused and crystallized on a lavish, self-indulgent monarch: Charles I. His resistance to parliamentary challenge meant that, from 1629, the people had been governed by arbitrary monarchical rule. His decision to levy various taxes to obtain revenue and his exploitation of press-gangs who forced unwilling souls into the navy, meant greater financial strain for his already beleaguered subjects and generated a real sense of bitterness. (&#x201c;Thus was the king&#x2019;s coffers filled with oppression,&#x201d; concluded one pamphlet in 1649.) His popularity was eroded further by his religious affiliations: not only had he displayed a preference for the High Anglican worship that would so alienate the Puritans and others of that ilk, he had also married a Catholic queen, Henrietta Maria, and allowed her to observe her faith publicly.<br><br>The wider political situation also contributed to the depressed mood of the country and the general suffering endured during this period. The Thirty Years War (1618&#x2013;48), which had seen warring Protestant and Catholic forces reduce much of Europe to a corpse-strewn battleground, further depleted the nation and contributed to profound collective dissatisfaction with the status quo. The decades from the 1630s through to the end of the 1650s were, according to the historian Peter Bowden, &#x201c;probably amongst the most terrible years through which the country had ever passed.&#x201d; He goes on: &#x201c;It is probably no coincidence that the first real beginnings of the colonisation of America dated from this period.&#x201d; Facing poverty, hunger and actual starvation at home, the populace were more than usually attentive to the pedlars of tales told in taverns of the lands across the sea, where everyone could have a full belly and their own property.<br><br>One such economic migrant was Richard Ligon. A cultured, educated gentleman of &#x201c;above sixty years&#x201d; who had served at Charles&#x202f;I&#x2019;s court, he sailed for Barbados in 1647. Ligon was untypical of most migrants to the Caribbean by virtue of his age and class. But his reasons for migrating&#x2014;essentially economic&#x2014;would have resonated with most of his contemporaries. Though in the &#x201c;last scene of my life,&#x201d; he had &#x201c;lost (by a Barbarous Riot) all I had gotten by the painful travels and cares of my youth . . . and left destitute of a subsistence.&#x201d; In this desperate condition he looked about for friends to support him, found none, and therefore considered himself &#x201c;a stranger in my own Countrey.&#x201d; As a result, he &#x201c;resolv&#x2019;d to lay on the first opportunity that might convey me to any other part of the World, how far distant soever, rather than abide here.&#x201d;</p><h2>Elysium</h2><p><b>Received the 2014 Philip K.

Their romance developed alongside Cold War conspiracies, the beginning of a terrible conflict in Kashmir, and an epic sweep of events that saw one million people killed and ten million dispossessed.</p><p>Steeped in the private papers and reflections of the participants, Alex von Tunzelmann's <i>Indian Summer </i>reveals, in vivid, exhilarating detail, how the actions of a few extraordinary people changed the lives of millions and determined the fate of nations.</p></p><p><p><b>Alex von Tunzelmann </b>was educated at Oxford and lives in London. <i>Indian Summer</i> is her first book.</p>On a warm summer night in 1947, the largest empire the world has ever seen did something no empire had done before. It gave up. The British Empire did not decline, it simply fell; and it fell proudly and majestically on to its own sword. It was not forced out by revolution, nor defeated by a greater rival in battle. Its leaders did not tire or weaken. Its culture was strong and vibrant. Recently it had been victorious in the century&#x2019;s definitive war. <br>When midnight struck in Delhi on the night of 14 August 1947, a new, free Indian nation was born. In London, the time was 8.30 p.m. The world&#x2019;s capital could enjoy another hour or two of a warm summer evening before the sun literally and finally set on the British Empire.<br><br>The constituent assembly of India was convened at that moment in New Delhi, a monument to the self-confidence of the British government, which had built its new capital on the site of seven fallen cities. Each of the seven had been built to last for ever. And so was New Delhi, a colossal arrangement of sandstone neoclassicism and wide boulevards lined with banyan trees. Seen from the sky, the interlocking series of avenues and roundabouts formed a pattern like the marble trellises of geometric stars that ventilated Mughal palaces. New Delhi was India, but constructed &#x2014; and, they thought, improved upon &#x2014; by the British. The French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau had laughed when he saw the new city half-built in 1920, and observed: &#x2018;<i>�a sera la plus magnifique de toutes ces ruines</i>.&#x2019;<br><br>Inside the chamber of the constituent assembly on the night of 14 August 1947, 2000 princes and politicians from across the 1.25 million square miles that remained of India sat together on parliamentary benches. Yet amid all the power and finery, two persons were conspicuous by their absence. One was Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, who was in one of those parts of the Empire that had just become Pakistan. His absence signified the partition of the subcontinent, the split which had ripped two wings off the body of India and called them West and East Pakistan (later Pakistan and Bangladesh), creating Muslim homelands separate from the predominantly Hindu mass of the territory. The other truant was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who was sound asleep in a smashed-up mansion in a riot-torn suburb of Calcutta.<br><br>Gandhi&#x2019;s absence was a worrying omen. The seventy-seven-year-old Mahatma, or &#x2018;great soul&#x2019;, was the most famous and the most popular Indian since Buddha. Regarded as little short of a saint among Christians as well as Hindus, he had been a staunch defender of the British Empire until the 1920s. Since then, he had campaigned for Indian self-rule. Many times it had been almost within his grasp: in 1922, 1931, 1942, 1946. Each time he had let it go. Now, finally, India was free, but that had nothing to do with Gandhi &#x2014; and Gandhi would have nothing to do with it. <br><br>In the chamber the dignitaries fell silent as the foremost among them, Jawaharlal Nehru, stepped up to make one of the most famous speeches in history. At fifty-seven years old, Nehru had grown into his role as India&#x2019;s leading statesman. His last prison term had finished exactly twenty-six months before. The fair skin and fine bone structure of an aristocratic Kashmiri Brahmin was rendered approachable by a ready smile and warm laugh. Dark, sleepy, soulful eyes belied a quick wit and quicker temper. In him were all the virtues of the ancient nation, filtered through the best aspects of the British Empire: confidence, sophistication, and charisma. &#x2018;Long years ago,&#x2019; he began, &#x2018;we made a tryst with destiny. And now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge; not wholly or in full measure, but substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, while the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom.&#x2019; The clock struck and, in that instant, he became the new country&#x2019;s first Prime Minister. The reverential mood in the hall was broken abruptly by an unexpected honk from the back. The dignitaries jerked their heads round to the source of the sound, and a look of relief passed over their faces as they saw a devout Hindu member of the assembly blowing into a conch shell &#x2014; an invocation of the gods. Mildred Talbot, a journalist who was present, noticed that the interruption had not daunted the new Prime Minister. &#x2018;When I happened to spot Nehru just as he was turning away, he was trying to hide a smile by covering his mouth with his hand.&#x2019;<br><br>It was the culmination of a lifetime&#x2019;s struggle; and yet, as Nehru later confided to his sister, his mind had not been on the splendid words. A few hours before, he had received a telephone call from Lahore in what was about to become West Pakistan. It was his mother&#x2019;s home town, and a place where he had spent much of his childhood.4 Now it was being torn apart. Gangs of Muslims and Sikhs had clashed in the streets. The main gurdwara &#x2014; the Sikh temple &#x2014; was ablaze. One hundred thousand people were trapped inside the city walls without water or medical assistance. Violence was a much-predicted consequence of the handover, but preparations for dealing with it had been catastrophically inadequate. The only help available in Lahore was from 200 Gurkhas, stationed nearby, under the command of an inexperienced British captain who was only twenty years old. They had little chance of stopping the carnage. The horror of that night in Lahore set the tone for weeks of bloodshed and destruction. Perhaps the Hindu astrologers had been right when they had declared 14 August to be an inauspicious date. Or perhaps the Viceroy&#x2019;s curious decision to rush independence through ten months ahead of the British government&#x2019;s schedule was to blame.<br><br>Emerging into the streets of Delhi, Nehru was greeted by the ringing of temple bells, the bangs and squeals of fireworks and the happy shouting of crowds. Guns were fired, in celebration rather than in anger; an effigy of British imperialism was burned, in both. . . .</p><h2>Recollections of a Picture Dealer (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)</h2><p><p>Celebrity, art merchant, socialite, publisher, and writer, Ambroise Vollard (1867&#x2013;1939) was one of the most extraordinary figures in 20th-century art. He possessed an uncanny ability to recognize genius in painters &#x2014; dozens of important artists received valuable commissions and gallery space with his help, and his galleries presented the first one-man shows for such luminaries as Matisse, C�zanne, and Picasso. Vollard's warmth, candor, and intelligence earned him the friendship of a generation of artists and make this memoir an enthralling and often hilarious account of an exciting Golden Age of painting.<br>Vollard's anecdotal recollections transport the reader to Paris at the turn of the 20th century and the legendary "Street of Pictures," the rue Laffitte, where Vollard lived and worked. Rather than critiquing artists or esthetic movements, Vollard focuses on the human sidelights that made his life as picture dealer so rich and fascinating: his early efforts to sell the works of C�zanne, despite incredible opposition to Impressionism; his dinner parties, whose guests included Renoir, Forain, Degas, Redon, and Rodin; his many portrait sittings for C�zanne, Renoir, Rouault, Bonnard, Forain, and Picasso; his observation on the studios, habits, and personalities of Manet, Matisse, Picasso, de Groux, Signac, and Rousseau; and his encounters with Gertrude Stein, Alfred Jarry, Guillaume Apollinaire, Mallarm�, and Zola.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Thinking through Painting: Reflexivity and Agency beyond the Canvas (Sternberg Press / Institut f�r Kunstkritik series)</h2><p><p>Painting has demonstrated remarkable perseverance in the expanding field of contemporary art and the surrounding ecology of media images.

My friends call me Nix.<br> <br>I was born right around the time the world died. A plague turned everyone into zombies. Actual living dead.<br> <br>No one knows where it started. Or how. Or why.<br> <br>It spread fast, though. By the time people realized that there was a problem, the problem was biting them. Then everything went crazy. There was a day the survivors call First Night. That was the point at which no one could ignore the problem. No one could say that it wasn&#x2019;t really happening, or even if it was, it wasn&#x2019;t happening here. It was happening everywhere.<br> <br>The year I was born, the United States Census Bureau estimated that there were 6,922,000,000 people alive on planet Earth. My mom says that probably a billion people died on First Night. And over the next few days and weeks, nearly everybody died. They used to have something called the &#x201c;Internet.&#x201d; Before that went down, the estimates of the global death toll were at three billion and climbing. After that there were no more news reports. There was no one left to report it. And after the power grids failed, there was no way to report it.<br> <br>The world went dark and it went silent.<br> <br>Except for the sound the dead make. Moans. Like they&#x2019;re hungry.<br> <br>And they are hungry. All the time.<br> <br>They want to eat people.<br> <br>Animals, too. They&#x2019;ll eat anything alive. That&#x2019;s why the world&#x2019;s so empty. The dead rose and they ate everyone.<br> <br>Well, not everyone, I suppose. My teachers say that the dead killed enough people for everything to fall apart. My history teacher said the outbreak destroyed what he called &#x201c;the infrastructure.&#x201d; Which is police and government and hospitals and like that. My health class teacher says it was disease, malnutrition, and bad water that killed most of the others.<br> <br>Problem is, no matter how someone dies, they come back to life as a zombie.<br> <br>Everyone.<br> <br>Which meant that the survivors kept having to run to find a safe place to hide. And to find food and stuff. To find medicine.<br> <br>Mom ran. She took me with her.<br> <br>I used to have a dad, and brothers. I never knew them. I was too little, and when Mom ran&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she was running from them. Or from what they had become.<br> <br>Mom doesn&#x2019;t talk about that. I don&#x2019;t think she can.<br> <br>I grew up in Mountainside. It isn&#x2019;t a real town, or at least it didn&#x2019;t use to be. Before First Night it was a reservoir built against a mountain wall in Mariposa County in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of central California. Not too far from Yosemite National Park. A bunch of people who were on the run found it. The reservoir had a fence, and that kept the people alive. Then more and more people found it, and when the big panic started to settle down, the people sent out teams to raid local houses and towns and stores for building materials, food, beds, clothes, and all sorts of stuff. They found a construction supply company a few miles from here, and they brought back miles of chain-link fence. Pretty soon they had a kind of town.<br> <br>That was fourteen years ago.<br> <br>Since then people have built eight other towns along the Sierra Nevadas. At the New Year&#x2019;s census, the total population of the nine towns here in central California is 28,261. Mom&#x2019;s friend Tom Imura says that there are maybe five hundred to a thousand people living outside the towns. Out in the Rot and Ruin. Out where the zoms are. Loners, scavengers who raid towns for supplies, bounty hunters, and a bunch of crazy monks who live in old gas stations and who think the zoms are the meek who were supposed to inherit the earth. Add them to the people in the towns, and there are still fewer than thirty thousand people left.<br> <br>Thirty thousand of us and nearly seven billion zoms.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve never been outside the fence line. Neither have most of the people in town. People here hardly even talk about what&#x2019;s out there. They talk about the other towns as if they&#x2019;re in different countries. We get news from them, and once in a rare while a traveler goes from one town to another. But everything else is the Rot and Ruin.<br> <br>My mom wants me to live here. To &#x201c;be content&#x201d; because I&#x2019;m safe and alive.<br> <br>Behind the fences.<br> <br>In a cage.<br> <br>Sometimes I think the fence isn&#x2019;t just for keeping the zoms out. I think it&#x2019;s to keep us in. We built it and we locked ourselves in.<br> <br>I hate it.<br> <br>I can&#x2019;t live in a cage.<br> <br>I won&#x2019;t.<br> <br>But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don&#x2019;t know how to escape the cage when everything outside is the Ruin. Out there, everything wants to kill you. Everyone says that.<br> <br>Still&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if I have to live my whole life in a cage, then I know I&#x2019;ll go crazy.<br> <br>There has to be a way out.<br> <br>There has to be.</p><h2>Phineas Redux (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>In the fourth of the 'Palliser' stories, Trollope follows Phineas Finn's return to the dangerous world of Westminster politics.

The sixty stories in this collection of Village memories are exuberant, poignant, original, and vivid-perfectly capturing the essence of the Village. <br><br>Every corner of the Village is represented in the book: recollections of jazz clubs and existentialism on Bleecker Street, rock music at St. Mark's Place, folk singers in Washington Square Park. There are stories of Hans Hofmann teaching modern art on 8th Street and Lotte Lenya performing in <i>The Threepenny Opera</i> on Christopher Street. Decades later, Brooke Shields muses on renovating a brownstone and finding history behind its walls; and Mario Batali lyrically describes a Sunday morning walk through the food markets of Bleecker Street. The stories are complemented by a wide range of photographs by iconic figures such as Allen Ginsberg, Rudy Burckhardt, Berenice Abbott, Saul Leiter, Ruth Orkin, and Weegee. Paintings depict elegant red-brick facades and raffish Hudson River piers, now restored; theater posters spotlight Karen Finley and John Leguizamo.

Is it individual or imposed on us from the outside? Why are so many of us so intimidated when presented with the wine list at a restaurant? In <i>The Accidental Connoisseur</i>, journalist Lawrence Osborne takes off on a personal voyage through a little-known world in pursuit of some answers. Weaving together a fantastic cast of eccentrics and obsessives, industry magnates and small farmers, the author explores the way technological change, opinionated critics, consumer trends, wheelers and dealers, trade wars, and mass market tastes have made the elixir we drink today entirely different from the wine drunk by our grandparents.</p><p>In his search for wine that is a true expression of the place that produced it, Osborne takes the reader from the high-tech present to the primitive past. From a lavish lunch with wine tsar Robert Mondavi to the cellars of Marquis Piero Antinori in Florence, from the tasting rooms of Chateau Lafite to the humble vineyards of northern Lazio, Osborne winds his way through Renaissance palaces, $27 million wineries, tin shacks and garages, opulent restaurants, world-famous chais and vineyards, renowned villages and obscure landscapes, as well as the great cities which are the temples of wine consumption: New York, San Francisco, Paris, Florence, and Rome. On the way, we will be shown the vast tapestry of this much-desired, little-understood drink: who produces it and why, who consumes it, who critiques it? Enchanting, delightful, entertaining, and, above all, down to earth, this is a wine book like no other.</p></p><p><p><b>Lawrence Osborne</b> contributes frequently to <i>The New York Times Magazine, Lingua Franca, The New Republic, </i>and <i>Talk</i>, and is the author of<i> Paris Dreambook, The Poisoned Embrace, </i>and <i>American Normal</i>.

Drinking it has therefore never been second nature to me. Like most Catholic children, my first memory of wine is on the altar, and it was always a game to see how much of the sacrament you could gulp down when it was your turn to taste Our Lord&#x2019;s hemoglobin. It was sour, its dim taste mixed up with sickly sensations: the greasy fingers of our priests, cheap pewter goblets, and chewy, bready, polystyrenelike wafers.<br>I now think this sacred wine was a cheaper Sainsbury&#x2019;s Beaujolais, an economical option in the 1970s retailing for about three dollars a bottle, because with its taste of sour raspberries came also a ghostly scent of ripe bananas, which I have ever after associated with Our Lord&#x2019;s unfortunate decomposition on the Cross.<br>To many in Britain, wine was exotic, especially in the puritanical small commuter town of Haywards Heath where I grew up just south of London. In those days the dominant British chain wine store was Unwin&#x2019;s, and the Haywards Heath Unwin&#x2019;s was a place to buy crates of Smirnoff and dark blue bottles of Liebfraumilch, but almost nothing else, aside from those three-dollar bottles of Beaujolais. All drinks came under the Arabic word alcohol, essentially reducing them to the level of a chemical sin, and none of them could be bought on Sunday.<br>The wine store with its windows stuffed with loopy bottles of Mateus ros� in straw flasks was a place of vague iniquity, a place where immigrant Iberian bricklayers perhaps slaked their addictions in secret. In our house, wine was never drunk. Sunday lunch came with sherry and reconstituted fruit drinks, but never a wine. Even the word &#x201c;wine&#x201d; struck a strained note in many English gatherings.<br>This alienation left an inevitable mark. For me, as for most English speakers, wine became a consumer interest, but not an instinctual one. I have always been haunted by the same question: Do I really know what I&#x2019;m drinking and why? For that matter, how do I know that my own tastes are authentic? Wine is a dangerous game. Wherefore a sinister little hunch always creeps into my mind as I am drinking it: I do not trust my own taste.<br>Few things make us more insecure about taste than wine. Some seventy-five thousand different wines made in the world today sustain a $50 billion industry, but there are only a handful of real wine experts to help us sort them out. The language of their expertise may convince us on the page, but only adds to our confusion when we actually taste wine. Their encyclopedias tell us what we&#x2019;re supposed to taste, but never how each of us can appropriate the experience for ourselves. Taste is what defines our personality, but it&#x2019;s as solid as a soap bubble.<br>What, then, is taste? We secretly pride ourselves on our taste. Yet nothing is more terrifying to contemplate. And no taste is more awkward to contemplate than taste in wine. Wine is the ultimate exercise in this mysterious skill, this nuanced zone of pleasure. Nothing requires more taste than wine. For the greatest wines will provoke the most complex physiological reactions of any foodstuff.<br>Wine is now one of the dominant consumer fetishes of the Western world, with its own hyperventilating journalistic industry. One is bombarded with wine talk on all sides. Aim� Guibert, the noted French wine maker, has said: &#x201c;For millennia wine was the center of Western civilization. It has always been a mystery. Today it has been transformed into a commodity.&#x201d;<br>Wine guides, those irrefutable encyclopedias of taste, are ubiquitous. From Robert Parker&#x2019;s Wine Enthusiast and Wine Buyer&#x2019;s Guide, to Frank Schoonmaker&#x2019;s 1964 Encyclopedia of Wine, to the works of the nineteenth-century connoisseur George Saintsbury and the twentieth-century one Gerald Asher, to Alexis Lichine&#x2019;s classic Encyclopedia of Wines and Spirits and the Larousse Encyclopedia of Wine. So many encyclopedias, so little time!<br>But there is the rub. Taste is not learned out of books; it is not given from one person to another. Therein lies its profundity. At school, fatuous masters would say of poems they didn&#x2019;t like, using the old Latin saw, De gustibus non disputandum est&#x2014;there&#x2019;s no accounting for taste. And so there isn&#x2019;t. Taste is like a perverse coral: it grows slowly and inexorably into unpredictable shapes, precisely because it&#x2019;s an offshoot of living itself. Acquiring taste, then, is not a result of study; it&#x2019;s a talent for living life.<br>A distrust of our own taste is what defines us as what could be called accidental drinkers. And the more I have tried to make my little steps toward accidental connoisseurship, the more I have made a fool of myself.<br>I once happened to be sitting alone in the restaurant called Le Verger des Papes just underneath the ruined castle of Ch�teauneuf-du-Pape in the southern Rh�ne, in the heart of a world-famous wine country. The place was deserted except for a thin professorial type at the neighboring table eating a salad. The waiter came and asked me what I wanted to drink. I scanned the list and didn&#x2019;t recognize a single thing, an extraordinary feat since the list contained just about every popularly known Ch�teauneuf-du-Pape there is. My eye caught the name Beaucastel: the most expensive item on the list. I ordered it.<br>Halfway through the Beaucastel, which cost twice as much as the whole meal, I thought I should engage in some small wine talk with the waiter. We bantered about Beaucastel. Neither of us knew anything about it, but the waiter offered some opinions which he had probably read in the newspaper.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you find,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;that there&#x2019;s a funny taste of chicken coops in Rh�ne wines? Especially Beaucastel.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Chicken coops?&#x201d; Was he pulling my leg?<br>&#x201c;Even the great wines, you know, have a whiff of chicken coops. It&#x2019;s well known.&#x201d;<br>I offered him a glass of the Beaucastel. I tasted it again, now frantically looking for traces of sublimated chicken coops. The waiter winked at me: was he suggesting I&#x2019;d been had?<br>&#x201c;Taste it?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;A bit poopy, eh?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;maybe I can taste chicken coops.&#x201d;<br>I couldn&#x2019;t taste anything of the sort. But we swirled and sipped and agreed that the chicken-coop element gave the wine its complexity.<br>At this moment, the man next to us suddenly came to life, sat up erect, and said, &#x201c;Brettanomyces!&#x201d; He drawled this extraordinary word, suspending his fork in midair and sending us a wan smile.<br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Brettanomyces.&#x201d; I saw that his nose was quite red and that he was possibly even drunker than I. &#x201c;Brett,&#x201d; he went on. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a yeast. That chicken-coop taste comes from a yeast called brett. Brett is everywhere in Rh�ne wines. Especially Beaucastel.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s very good,&#x201d; I said stupidly.<br>He and the waiter laughed.<br>&#x201c;I can see, monsieur,&#x201d; the tipsy professor said, &#x201c;that you are a man of taste. Men of taste, monsieur, are few and far between.&#x201d; The irony seeped delicately through his sentences and he wiped his mustache with a napkin as I poured him a glass as well. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;here&#x2019;s to chicken coops!&#x201d;<br>The word &#x201c;taste&#x201d; comes from the Old French taster, &#x201c;to feel,&#x201d; whose medieval English equivalent was tasten. The French word itself descended from the Latin taxare, &#x201c;to evaluate, handle.&#x201d;<br>Ultimately, all these words derive from the Latin tangere, &#x201c;to touch.&#x201d; In the sense of &#x201c;aesthetic judgment,&#x201d; however, &#x201c;taste&#x201d; only arrived in English in 1674, and the term &#x201c;tasteful&#x201d; dates only from 1756. Our conventional notion of &#x201c;taste&#x201d; is essentially an eighteenth-century invention.<br>The eighteenth century was obsessed with taste. It became the greatest of all bourgeois fads, and dozens of treatises on taste duly appeared, almost none of them readable. The most famous of them all was Dr. Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin&#x2019;s Physiology of Taste, published in Paris in 1826. Many regard it as the gastronomic Bible; others think it&#x2019;s as overrated as Casanova&#x2019;s memoirs. But does it tell us anything about taste?<br>The doctor begins by admitting that it&#x2019;s a tough subject. &#x201c;It is not easy,&#x201d; he concedes glumly, &#x201c;to determine precisely what parts make up the organ of taste. It is more complicated than it seems.&#x201d;<br>Taste, he theorizes, is divided into three classes (eighteenth-century theorists nearly always divide everything into threes):<br>In physical man it is the apparatus by which he distinguishes various flavours. In moral man it is the sensation which stimulates that organ in the center of his feeling which is influenced by any savorous body. Lastly, in its own material significance, taste is the property possessed by any given substance which can influence the organ and give birth to sensation.<br>It was clear to Brillat-Savarin that the tongue was the central muscle of taste. But he also observed that people deprived of that subtle organ could still taste, in a manner. In Amsterdam, he had met an errand runner whose tongue had been cut out by Algerian slave dealers. Communicating by means of little written notes, the doctor and the lingual amputee carried on a lively discussion about taste. The errand boy could still taste things, though swallowing was a torture. Even so, the doctor concludes that all tongues are not created equal. And even though, as he says, &#x201c;the space between something called good and something re...</p><h2>A Zoo In Winter</h2><p>THE PLEASURE OF DRAWINGKyoto, 1966.

Historian Felipe Fern�ndez-Armesto's <i>Near a Thousand Tables</i> places its beginnings in cooking, a social act that forges culture (and is perhaps responsible for it), then pursues it as a series of "revolutions"--from the inception of cooking, herding, and agriculture to food industrialization and, finally, modern globalization. Informatively dense yet spry and aphoristic, the book explores food as rite and magic (it "binds those who believe, brands those who don't"); the domestication of animals (snails are the world's oldest "cattle"); farming and food's use as an index of rank ("greatness goes with greatness of girth"--or at least it did); food's role in trade and cultural exchange (Tex-Mex cooking as a form of colonial miscegenation); and as a force in and for industrialization (canning as the cooking of the Industrial Revolution). In the end, we are brought to "the loneliness of the fast food eater" and the "desocializing" effect of microwave cooking and other forms of modern food manipulation that alienate us from the communal act that "made" culture. "Food gives pleasure," Fern�ndez-Armesto writes, and "can change the eater for better or worse." He concludes, "the role of the next revolution will be to subvert the last."<p> This is a fascinating book that shows us ourselves: like the cannibal, who eats his enemy to appropriate his power, we believe in food's transformative effect, which through devotion to vegetarianism and other special diets will make us "better." It paints a picture both sweeping and precise. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p><b>Felipe Fern�ndez-Armesto</b> is a Professorial Fellow of Queen Mary, University of London, and a member of the Modern History Faculty at Oxford University.

Svenson, a prolific yet somewhat anonymous, writer of books for children. Jerry West was the pen name assigned to Svenson when he started writing The Happy Hollisters for the Stratemeyer Syndicate, a book packager well-known for its development of children's book series including Tom Swift, The Bobbsey Twins, The Hardy Boys, and Nancy Drew. Many of these series were intended to have long publishing lives, and were written by multiple authors using the same pseudonym. The Happy Hollisters, however, were all written by Andrew Svenson, whose identity as Jerry West was kept secret until several years after his death in 1975. Andrew Svenson was born in Belleville, NJ, in 1910, and his interest in writing started early. He was editor of his high school newspaper and yearbook at Barringer High School in Newark, and then went on to study Creative Writing at the University of Pittsburgh. After his graduation in 1932, he worked as a reporter and editor for the Newark Star Eagle and the Newark Evening News. During this time, Andrew Svenson was encouraged by his friend and co-worker Howard Garis (author of Uncle Wiggily) to try his hand at juvenile fiction. Svenson joined the Stratemeyer Syndicate in 1948, where he contributed to established series as Franklin W. Dixon (The Hardy Boys) and as Laura Lee Hope (The Bobbsey Twins). The first volume in The Happy Hollisters was published in 1953 by Doubleday &amp; Company, and he was made a partner in the Stratemeyer Syndicate in 1961. As he wrote and developed 33 titles in The Happy Hollisters, he was also creating additional series for children under other pen names: Bret King by Dan Scott and The Tollivers by Alan Stone, the first series written for and about African-American children. Andrew Svenson wrote more than 70 adventure and mystery novels for children, which were published in 17 languages and sold millions of copies. The Hollister family was modeled on his own family and he often used Svenson family events and travels as the foundation for The Happy Hollisters books. He also kept copious newspaper clippings for story ideas, and interviewed hundreds of school children and teachers for additional suggestions. These ideas were worked into his storylines, adding an educational element that was appreciated by parents and educators alike. Children loved the books for their elements of danger and excitement geared to their comprehension level.</p><h2>The Providence of God (Contours of Christian Theology)</h2><p>In this concise and accessible introduction, Paul Helm outlines for students and interested readers the doctrine of divine providence. Unlike many doctrinal treatments, his approach is not historically oriented. Instead Helm focuses on the underlying metaphysical and moral aspects of God&#39;s providence, paying particular attention to the ideas of divine control, providence and evil, and the role of prayer in relationship to providence.</p><p>In this book I offer a view of my own, though not one that is peculiar to me. The chief reason for this approach is to try to avoid the blandness and obliqueness that often come from setting one view beside another in a &#39;neutral&#39; way. - from the Introduction by the author.Paul Helm is a teaching fellow in theology and philosophy at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia. From 1993 to 2000 he taught as professor of the history and philosophy of religion at King's College, University of London. He has published numerous books and articles, including <em>Eternal God: A Study of God Without Time</em> (Oxford University Press, 1988), <em>Belief Politics</em> (Cambridge University Press, 1994) and <em>Faith and Understanding</em> (Eerdmans, 1997).</p><h2>Father Smith Instructs Jackson</h2><p><b>Father Smith Instructs Jackson: Centennial Edition!</b><p></p><p>Over 3 million copies of this timeless classic have been sold, and it has influenced thousands of conversions.

It is one-on-one catechesis at its finest, delivered in a relevant and practical context -- much like Jesus himself taught.</p><p>With fresh references and updated language supplied by noted Church scholar Paul Thigpen, this is a book that Catholics and non-Catholics alike can turn to for greater personal understanding of the intricacies and nuances of the Faith.</p></p><p>Archbishop John Francis Noll (1875-1956) had a significant impact on Catholic publishing during his 58 years of priestly ministry. His skill in defending and explaining the Faith was honed during the early 1900s, when he began his mission work to non-Catholics, often attending Klu Klux Klan and other anti-Catholic rallies in order to directly confront the speakers and attendees. He launched what has become one of the largest Catholic publishing houses in the world, Our Sunday Visitor. In addition to creating a national Catholic newspaper and distributing millions of topical pamphlets on the Faith, he published several books, among which <b>Father Smith Instructs Jackson</b> quickly became a best-seller. He earned the honorary title of Archbishop as a sign of the Vatican's esteem for his work.<br><br>Paul Thigpen is the editor of Our Sunday Visitor's <i>The Catholic Answer</i> magazine.

Booth belongs to the same Rebel militia as Martha&#x2019;s hot-headed brother Richard, who has gone missing along with Booth. Martha is loyal to her brother but in love with Nicholas McComas, a local hero of the Union cause, and their affair is fraught with echoes of the bloody conflict just ended.<br><br>The story is set in Northern Maryland, six miles below the Mason-Dixon line, where brothers literally fought on opposing sides, and former slave-owners live next door to abolitionists and freed men. Such tension proves key to Martha&#x2019;s motives in killing the man she loves, and why astonishingly she is soon acquitted by a jury of her peers, despite more than fifty eyewitnesses to the crime.</p><p>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by by Robert Goolrick On April 10, 1869, in Jarrettsville, Md., a young mother shoots her lover to death in the middle of the main street with 50 witnesses looking on in horror and then sits down with her victim's head in her lap, weeping uncontrollably, asking to be hanged before dark. How this remarkable scene came to pass and its equally remarkable aftermath make up Cornelia Nixon's fine and compelling new novel. An award-winning short story writer and the author of two previous novels, Nixon has ghosts to exorcise here. "Jarrettsville" is an embroidery of imagination on a true piece of her family history, sewn together from old family papers and letters, newspaper accounts and graveyard records. But the story, as vivid as it is, is overshadowed by an even more looming ghost in the nation's family history: the legacy of racism. "Jarrettsville" describes the tangled and ultimately tragic romance between Martha Jane Cairnes and Nick McComas. Their story is inextricable from the history of their small town, six miles below the Mason-Dixon line, and of the still unended agony of the Civil War. The two share high spirits and romantic passions, but they also share abolitionist views that run counter to those of many of their neighbors and family relations. It would seem simple enough to be young and good-looking and to fall in love and marry, but in the slanderous and racially charged atmosphere of the just-post-Civil War years, there is not a single human exchange that does not pass through a filter of distrust and rage. No moment of their lives is safe from the venom of racial hatred. Just because the story is filled with hoop skirts, fainting ladies and dashing cavaliers on horseback, don't mistake it for one of those historical romances that feature hoop skirts, fainting ladies and dashing cavaliers on horseback. Nixon is too good for that. Her writing is like an easy-gaited horse; one notices not so much the power as the fluidity of motion. Some of the best moments are the quietest ones. For instance, we see Martha Jane and her former slave, Tim, settled peacefully 50 feet above the ground among the branches of a pine tree, old friends who have known each other since childhood and who have shared their first, experimental kiss. But then, at the sound of hooves on the forest floor, they both feel the fear of being caught in what is, even to them, an unacceptable and compromising position. Later, Martha Jane and Nick fall in love against the wishes of their families, become engaged and move with agonizing slowness toward a sexual relationship, encumbered not only by the morals of the day but also by all those hoops and crinolines and corsets. Once the laces are finally undone, though, he gets her pregnant before their marriage, and they find themselves hounded by rumors that the actual father is Tim. Unfortunately, the final third of the book doesn't live up to the passion of the earlier sections. The end of the story is both expected and less vivid than the beginning, but perhaps that is due, in part, to the fact that the conclusion to the larger story, the story of race in this country, has yet to be written. The awful racial epithet that still haunts the American debate is said only once in Nixon's novel, at a town meeting by a die-hard fanatic who believes that the South will rise from the ashes at any cost. Even in 1869, it had the power to shock and repel, along with the power to enflame and embolden. But even unsaid, the word infuses every important action of this story and brings these charming, innocent lovers to ruin. The destructive force behind that word has only grown in the intervening century and a half. bookworld@washpost.com <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post. All Rights Reserved.Post&#x2013;Civil War tensions complicate the romance between an abolitionist's son and the spirited sister of a rebel sympathizer in Nixon's uneven latest (after <i>Angels Go Naked</i>). Four years after the war, in Jarrettsville, Md., Martha Cairnes kills her fianc�, Nicholas McComas, and demands to be arrested and hanged. The narrative then moves backward to explain how the lovers came together: Martha falls for Nick even though he has a reputation as a scoundrel. Nick, meanwhile, thinks marriage is out of the question, especially after it's revealed that his father, killed under mysterious circumstances, has left behind a mountain of debt. Yet the two are soon engaged, and Martha's brother, who may have been involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, resents Nick's efforts to support three former Cairnes slaves, and a tangle of crossed loyalties wreak havoc on the engagement. Nixon tells the tale � la <i>Shadow Country</i>, with a chorus of narrators, but here the variety of voices and the disparate narrative elements&#x2014;historical account, tragic romance, courtroom drama&#x2014;renders unclear what kind of story the author is trying to tell, and the riveting beginning is sabotaged by the restrained conclusion. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Each volume&#x2019;s series editor selects notable works from hundreds of magazines, journals, and websites. A special guest editor, a leading writer in the field, then chooses the best twenty or so pieces to publish.

She writes, Each form relies on suggestion and economy. Characters have to be drawn in a few deft strokes. There s generally a setup, a reveal, a reversal, and a release . . . In the joke and in the short story, the beginning and end are precisely anchored tent poles, and what lies between must pull so taut it twangs. </p><p>The twenty tightly crafted stories collected here are full of deftly drawn characters, universal truths, and often, like good jokes, surprising humor. Richard Powers s To the Measures Fall is a comic meditation on the uses of literature in the course of a life. In the satirical The Sleep, Caitlin Horrocks puts her fictional prairie town to bed the inhabitants hibernate through the long winter as a form of escape while in Steve Millhauser s imagined town the citizens are visited by ghostlike apparitions in The Phantoms. Allegra Goodman s spare but beautiful La Vita Nuova finds a jilted fiancee letting her art class paint all over her wedding dress as a poignant act of release. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie wryly captures the social change in the air in Lagos, Nigeria, in her story of a wealthy young man who is not entirely at ease with what his life has become. </p><p>As Brooks pursued these richly imagined and varied landscapes she found that it was like walking into the best kind of party, where you can hole up in a corner with old friends for a while, then launch out among interesting strangers. <br>"</p>Geraldine Brooks&nbsp;was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in fiction in 2006 for her novel <i>March</i>.&nbsp; Her first novel, <i>Year of Wonders</i>, is an international bestseller, and her novel&nbsp;<i>People of the Book&nbsp;</i>was a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller translated into 20 languages.

He lives in New York City.</p>Price (The Breaks, 1982, etc.) has spent the past ten years writing for Hollywood (Sea of Love, etc.)--but you wouldn't know it from the dense textures and supple dramatics of this epic slice of urban grit about frazzled drug-dealers and burnt-out cops. Of the many impeccably authentic urban types here, Price focuses on two: 20-ish ``Strike'' Dunham, black chief of a crew of crack-dealers (``clockers'') in the dead-end burg of Dempsy, N.J., and 43-year-old white Dempsy homicide cop Rocco Klein. Each is suffering an identity crisis when a murder puts them on a collision course. Strike, in a constant panic from dealing with his homicidal boss, crack-kingpin Rodney Little, is considering changing jobs; Rocco, six months from retirement, is thinking that his life is a big zero--a nullity underlined by his humiliating antics to curry the favor of a film star who might portray him in a movie. Then someone guns down another of Little's henchmen, and--shocking both Strike and Rocco--Strike's solid-citizen older brother, Victor, confesses to the killing: ``self-defense,'' he claims. Not so, thinks Rocco, who decides that Victor is covering for Strike and starts harassing the young dealer by framing him as a stoolie- -certain death at Little's hands. Meanwhile, myriad subplots vivify Strike's and Rocco's worlds: Rocco initiates the film star into the horrors of jail-life; Strike apprentices a young boy into dealing; Rocco's baby girl disappears; Little's legendary hit man wastes away from AIDS; Strike nearly dies from a bleeding ulcer. Finally, Strike, with a vengeful Little literally steps behind, turns to Rocco for help--a move that allows both to find a kind of hope and renewal. A vital and bold novel rich in unexpected pleasure, with Price generally avoiding melodrama, sentimentality, and stereotype to portray a harsh world with cleareyed compassion.

Enraptured children sat in front of me, waiting for me to begin the story of the first avian queen. Blatantly out of place among them was a friend of mine, a serpiente dancer named Urban, who was lounging near the back, managing to look bored and nervous at the same time.<br><br>"Many, many years ago, our ancestors were a collection of small tribes, each led by a different captain and each squabbling with its neighbors over food, water and shelter. When drought caused famine, they became afraid and so were more protective of their scarce belongings.<br><br>"In the middle of the worst winter, when early snows had destroyed too many of the crops, a woman named Aleya gave birth to a daughter. She loved her child, but she knew she could never take care of her. So Aleya brought the beautiful golden girl to the mountains and left her there, praying that the wild spirits would care for her.<br><br>"The infant began to cry, and soon a pair bond of hawks landed beside her. They cared for the child as one of their own, teaching her the language of the forest and giving her their most precious gift: the skies. They gave the girl some of their magic and taught her how to change from her human form into that of a golden hawk."<br><br>I paused there, looking into the wide eyes of my young audience. One of the children had moved closer to Urban and was trying to examine the silk scarf he had tied around his waist--a melos, one of the accessories worn by professional serpiente dancers. Urban glanced at her and she jumped.<br><br>"But there comes a time when every chick must leave its nest, and as she grew older, the hawk-girl began to wonder about her true mother. Finally, when she was thirteen, she returned to her homeland. She found her mother and her younger brother, whom she had never known, but was horrified by the conditions in which they lived, by the fear and anger that seemed ever present among humans.<br><br>"The girl led first her family and then the rest of her mother's tribe into the woods and taught them how to reach the skies. She showed them better ways to hunt, with a hawk's vision and talons, and so they became healthy and well fed once again.<br><br>"Later, other tribes joined them, and each took a form from the wilderness--ravens, crows and then sparrows. For the first time, these tribes lived peacefully together, led by the young queen they named Alasdair, which means protector."<br><br>The children clapped happily, making the bells hanging from their wrists jingle.<br><br>I smiled, enjoying the story almost as much as I had during my first Festival--until one of the adults who had been nearby noticed her child reaching for Urban's melos again and darted forward to scoop her up and away from Urban. Urban pretended not to notice, but I saw his back tense.<br><br>I had told the story of Alasdair the way my mother had used to tell it to me, but I knew that some of these children had learned a darker ending from their parents. <br>Just twenty years before, the myth always would have included the death of Alasdair at the hands of the serpiente. Tales such as these fueled avians' hatred from the cradle.<br><br>I tried not to let the avian mother's reaction to Urban ruin my mood. I knew that many people did not approve of his presence there; Urban was not just a serpent--an apprentice dancer, at that--he was widely known to be my foremost suitor among the serpiente. As such, he faced the wrath of mothers with eligible sons, and of course the jealousy of avian men our age, in addition to the general prejudice of avians against serpiente.<br><br>Still, I was glad he had come. Suitor or not, Urban was one of my closest friends. We had grown up together. It meant a lot to me that he was willing to be there even though he knew how the avians might react.<br><br>"Bit of a dull story," Urban remarked as he came to my side, trying to keep a careful distance between himself and the avians around us. "Lacks intrigue, danger, scandal."<br><br>"Well, I'm sorry that the way my ancestor saved her people from starvation and war isn't racy enough for you," I said, teasing.<br><br>Serpiente history--which, unlike the avian stories, was regarded as fact, not myth--involved the brave leader of a clan known as the Dasi seducing a powerful creature called Leben, who had impersonated one of their gods to demand their worship. The story, which was told each year in the dance named after the winter solstice holiday Namir-da, described how Leben had given all of Maeve's people second forms to try to win her favor. Maeve had been given the form of a white viper. Kiesha, the high priestess of Anhamirak, had been given the form of a king cobra. Seven others had been given serpent forms, and four, the followers of the god Ahnmik, had been given falcon forms.<br><br>The Namir-da did not tell the falcons' story. It also did not include the part about the Dasi being torn apart by a vicious civil war shortly after the gifts had been given. Maeve and the four falcons had been exiled on charges of black magic. The white vipers still lived on the fringes of our society even in modern day, while Cjarsa, Araceli, Syfka and Servos made up the royal house of the falcon empire. Kiesha's people became the serpiente; my family were her descendents.<br><br>"Unfortunately," Urban continued, his tone making clear that he found nothing unfortunate in it, "I need to run to the nest now. I'm hoping to catch Salem before he is surrounded by people." Only the full members of the dancer's nest had been invited to Salem's initiation ceremony, and though Urban had grown up in the nest, he had not yet taken his vows. However, the reception that night would be open to anyone who wanted to attend, including apprentices and wyverns. "You will be there later, right?"<br><br>"Of course. I think my parents have already headed over."</p><h2>Letters to a Young Pastor</h2><p><b>Much has changed over Calvin Miller&#x2019;s decades of pastoral ministry, but he believes two things remain the same: God is love and people are broken.</b> Now God is calling young pastors to stand in that gap.

From the start the Marmont attracted filmdom's most famous stars and many noted writers as well. Its early guest list included Garbo, Harlow, Lombard, Bette Davis, Flynn, Stan Laurel, John Wayne and, later on, Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, Streisand and Sharon Tate. In the '60s and '70s the Marmont drew leading rock and folk stars, from Jagger to Baez, and TV performers like John Belushi, who died there.

Since the third edition came out in 1990, the field of leadership has expanded by an order of magnitude. This completely revised and updated fourth edition reflects the growth and changes in the study of leadership over the past seventeen years, with new chapters on transformational leadership, ethics, presidential leadership, and executive leadership. Throughout the <i>Handbook,</i> the contributions from cognitive social psychology and the social, political, communications, and administrative sciences have been expanded.<br> <br> As in the third edition, Bernard Bass begins with a consideration of the definitions and concepts used, and a brief review of some of the betterknown theories. Professor Bass then focuses on the personal traits, tendencies, attributes, and values of leaders and the knowledge, intellectual competence, and technical skills required for leadership. Next he looks at leaders' socioemotional talents and interpersonal competencies, and the differences in these characteristics in leaders who are imbued with ideologies, especially authoritarianism, Machiavellianism, and self-aggrandizement. A fuller examination of the values, needs, and satisfactions of leaders follows, and singled out for special attention are competitiveness and the preferences for taking risks. In his chapters on personal characteristics, Bass examines the esteem that others generally accord to leaders as a consequence of the leaders' personalities.<br> <br> The many theoretical and research developments about charisma over the past thirty years are crucial and are explored here in depth. Bass has continued to develop his theory of transformational leadership -- the paradigm of the last twenty years -- and he details how it makes possible the inclusion of a much wider range of phenomena than when theory and modeling are limited to reinforcement strategies. He also details the new incarnations of transformational leadership since the last edition.<br> <br> Bass has greatly expanded his consideration of women and racial minorities, both of whom are increasingly taking on leadership roles.<br> <br> A glossary is included to assist specialists in a particular academic discipline who may be unfamiliar with terms used in other fields.<br> <br> Business professors and students, executives in every industry, and politicians at all levels have relied for years on the time-honored guidance and insight afforded by the <i>Handbook.</i></p><p><b>Dr. Bernard M.

Her servants and four of her ex-husbands are suspects in the case, all with weak alibis. It is up to Chan to solve the murder. The clues are cryptic and misleading by nature: the singer&#39;s own revolver, two scarves, two cigarette boxes with mismatched lids, and the actions of a little dog named Trouble.

This is the context of these lectures, among Steiner's most accessible on education.<br><br>A teacher who attended the lectures wrote in the <i>Berne School Paper</i>:<br><br>Every morning, as we listened anew to Dr. Steiner, we felt we had come closer to him and understood better what he had to say and how he had to say it. Daily, we newcomers gathered, asking ourselves, "Why are more of our colleagues not here? It is untrue that anthroposophy limits a person, develops blinkers, or avoids real life.... For, step-by-step, Dr. Steiner shows its application to life ... illuminating the details, disclosing their connection with profound questions of life and existence." I came to the conference to stimulate my school work. I found benefit in abundance. But also, I unexpectedly received a greater richness for heart and soul&#x2015;and, from this in turn shall stream richness for my classes.<br> In other words, these lectures are ideal for anyone first approaching Waldorf education. Using language that any teacher or parent can understand, Steiner goes into the essentials of his educational philosophy, providing many examples and anecdotes to convey his meaning. In this way, against the background of the developing child, he allows the curriculum and the method of teaching to emerge as the commonsense conclusion of practical experience. <br><br>German source: <i>Die p�dagogisch Praxis vom Geichtspunkte geisteswissenschaftlicher Menschenerkenntnis</i> (GA 306).</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.

He argues that this transformation has been driven in part by the pharmaceutical industry, which benefits by promoting its products to the larger percentage of the population at risk for a particular illness, rather than the smaller percentage who are actually affected by it. Meanwhile, for those suffering from chronic illness, the experience of risk and disease has been conflated by medical practitioners who focus on anticipatory treatment as much if not more than on relieving suffering caused by disease. Drawing on such controversial examples as HPV vaccines, cancer screening programs, and the cancer survivorship movement, Aronowitz argues that patients and their doctors have come to believe, perilously, that far too many medical interventions are worthwhile because they promise to control our fears and reduce uncertainty.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Risky Medicine </i>is a timely call for a skeptical response to medicine&#x2019;s obsession with risk, as well as for higher standards of evidence for risk-reducing interventions and a rebalancing of health care to restore an emphasis on the actual curing of and caring for people suffering from disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>Robert Aronowitz</b> is professor and chair of the history and sociology of science at the University of Pennsylvania; he earned his medical degree from Yale University. His books include <i>Making Sense of Illness: Science, Society, and Disease</i> and <i>Unnatural History: Breast Cancer and American Society</i>. He lives in Merion Station, Pennsylvania.&#x201c;Americans have the most advanced (and expensive) health care&#x2014;but not the best health. Science and sociology historian Aronowitz suggests that our market-driven, risk management-focused health care culture has led to excessive tests and overdiagnosis. The cure? Reforming how we think about health and how it&#x2019;s practiced.&#x201d; (<i>Discover</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Aronowitz poses useful questions about how societies should decide which innovations to adopt and how much people should choose to know about what is happening inside their bodies.&#x201d; (<i>Financial Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;With approaches from multiple disciplines such as sociology, anthropology and history, and drawing on personal experiences as a physician, Aronowitz&#x2019;s book offers a critical perspective of the expanding centrality of risk in medicine and its effects on public health systems, clinical practice and disease experience. In this sense, Aronowitz&#x2019;s work is part of emerging scholarship on the centrality of risk in science and medicine. . . . The book is, therefore, both relevant and an important read for historians of medicine and science, economists, public health policy makers and medical practitioners.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Medical History</i>)<br><br>"The rise of medical statistics has not just changed the way physicians evaluate therapies. It has also fundamentally changed our understanding of health and disease. As physician and historian Robert Aronowitz argues in&nbsp;<i>Risky Medicine: Our Quest to Cure Fear and Uncertainty</i>, it is no longer necessary to feel ill in order to be ill. A patient may feel fine and yet be treated as sick because her indicators point to elevated risk of disease or premature death. The experience of being &#x201c;at risk&#x201d; has, Aronowitz contends, converged with the experience of disease itself." (<i>Boston Review</i>)<br><br>"In <i>Risky Medicine: Our Quest to Cure Fear and Uncertainty</i>, physician and leading medical historian Robert Aronowitz maps the historical emergence of the risk paradigm in health: the notion that the task of medicine is to reduce and &nbsp;manage the probability of future illness rather than treating present disease."<br> (<i>American Sociological Association</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Risky Medicine</i> examines the tremendous implications of the collapsing of risk and disease in contemporary American biomedicine.&nbsp;Across a series of historical and contemporary cases, and with great acuity, clinician/historian Aronowitz explains how we have come to the point where much of our medical care, health policy, and patient experience is shaped less by illness itself than its potential threat. This immensely intelligent, bold, yet humane book offers vital insight into the problems of overtreatment as well as new dimensions of embodiment and anxiety that follow from our focus on risk.&#x201d; (Julie Livingston, author of Improvising Medicine: An African Oncology Ward in an Emerging Cancer Epidemic)<br><br>&#x201c;An important, timely, and provocative analysis of our contemporary style of managing&#x2014;and experiencing&#x2014;disease. In today's world of &#x2018;risky medicine&#x2019; we have come to diagnose and treat likelihoods&#x2014;risk&#x2014;as much as pain and incapacity, without evaluating the costs as well as benefits of this novel medical regime. Aronowitz&#x2019;s forceful analysis makes clear the necessity for that critical evaluation; this book should be widely and enthusiastically reviewed.&#x201d; (Charles E. Rosenberg, author of Our Present Complaint: American Medicine, Then and Now)<br><br>&#x201c;In <i>Risky Medicine</i>, Aronowitz brilliantly analyzes the essential ironies of contemporary biomedicine. In our efforts to reduce the risk of disease, we may augment those very risks. In our efforts to reduce uncertainties about our health, we introduce new uncertainties. The traditional medical dictum of &#x2018;do no harm&#x2019; becomes virtually impossible in a technocentric medical world of monitoring, testing, and treatment.&nbsp; Physicians, historians, policy makers, and patients will all benefit from this powerful precautionary tale.&#x201d; (Allan M. Brandt, author of The Cigarette Century)<br><br>&#x201c;How did risk reduction become the mantra of modern medicine? <i>Risky Medicine</i> tells the important story of how disease and the risk of it have become collapsed to the point that it&#x2019;s no longer always clear which one we&#x2019;re actually treating. A physician and historian of medicine, Aronowitz surprises the reader with his counterintuitive arguments but never oversimplifies debates or caricatures the doctors, researchers, patients, and policy makers who figure in this compelling and incisive account. He shows us how medicine&#x2019;s risk revolution <i>matters</i>, both for individuals who must manage their fears in the face of uncertainty and for societies intent on improving health outcomes while controlling costs.&#x201d; (Steven Epstein, author of Inclusion: The Politics of Difference in Medical Research)<br><br>&#x201c;In this important new book, Aronowitz shows us how all aspects of the US health system, from prevention to cure, hospital stays to outpatient visits, fee-for-service to managed care, have become entangled in a sprawling morass of &#x2018;risky medicine&#x2019;<i>:</i> a preoccupation with reducing and managing risks of future disease rather than treating present illness. <i>Risky Medicine </i>skillfully traces how it is that&nbsp;we came to think of health and disease in terms of risks instead of symptoms, demonstrates why our increasing concern with risk leads to more healthcare spending without necessarily improving quality of life, and offers keen analysis and concrete policy suggestions to rethink the role of risk in health policy and medical practice. &nbsp;This should be required reading for anyone with a serious interest in the past, present, or future of health care in America.&#x201d; (Jeremy Greene, author of Generic: The Unbranding of Modern Medicine)</p><h2>CAUSE!: A Business Strategy for Standing Out in a Sea of Sameness</h2><p>According to Ken Blanchard, ''I love <i>CAUSE!</i> It's all about people and organizations who feel called to make a difference&#x2014;to serve a purpose far beyond the typical bottom line.

The book's extraordinary clarity makes it readily understandable by anyone with a keen interest in phonology. <p>The substance of phonology is more constant and more general than the limitations inherent in any particular theory or formalism may suggest. The book therefore provides a coherent account for beginner-students, rooted primarily - but by no means exclusively - in the phonology of English. No particular theory or formal apparatus is preferred over another; instead, the essence of phonology is provided in the most neutral possible way, for the maximum benefit of the reader. The book avoids entanglement in doctrinal disputes and formal minutiae, and aims instead for the general and the permanent.</p> <p>The book reviews all the major advances that have taken place in generative phonology over the past thirty years, including the recent Optimality Theory. Its many pedagogical features encourage interaction with the reader, and include a wealth of check-points, chapter previews and summaries, lists of key points, and exercises for further practice.</p></p><h2>Gold of Africa: Jewellery and Ornaments from Ghana, Cote d Ivoire, Mali and Senegal</h2><p>First editon bound in black cloth. 225 illustrations, 196 in color. 4to size, 247 pp. A Fine copy in a nice dj with tiny rub marks to the corners.

The financial woes of this relatively small European nation threaten the long-term viability of the Euro while exposing the flaws in the ideal of continental unity. "Solutions" proposed by Europe&#x2019;s combined leadership have sparked a war of prideful words and stubborn one-upmanship, and they are certain to fail, according to renowned economist James K. Galbraith, because they are designed for failure. It is this hypocrisy that prompted former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, when Galbraith arrived in Athens as an adviser, to greet him with the words &#x201c;Welcome to the poisoned chalice.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In this fascinating, insightful, and thought-provoking collection of essays&#x2014;which includes letters and private memos to both American and Greek officials, as well as other previously unpublished material&#x2014;Galbraith examines the crisis, its causes, its course, and its meaning, as well as the viability of the austerity program imposed on the Greek citizenry. It is a trenchant, deeply felt commentary on what the author calls &#x201c;economic policy as moral abomination,&#x201d; and an eye-opening analysis of a contemporary Greek tragedy much greater than the tiny economy of the nation itself.</p><p><b>James K.

Gives Syriza&#x2019;s take on a story often seen in the Anglophone press through the eyes of Brussels officials. . . .

Galbraith offers the most succinct explanation of why the system has benefited Germany at the expense of weaker economies."&#x2014;Andrew Moravcsik, <i>Foreign Affairs</i><br>"To have had Jamie Galbraith as my adviser in the Ministry of Finance, during our epic struggle against wholesale economic irrationality at the height of its vengefulness, was a blessing. To be able to count on Jamie Galbraith as a close friend borders on outrageously good fortune."&#x2014;Yanis Varoufakis<br>"One can only agree with James Galbraith when he observes that 'The economic crisis in Greece is one of the great economic and political dramas of our time . . . and a test case for the long-term viability of the Euro.' I greatly admire Professor Galbraith not only for his contributions to economic theory but also for his ability to free himself from the shackles of ideology and deal with reality as it effectively is. I fully concur with his conclusions."&#x2014;Giuseppe Guarino, Former Finance Minister of Italy<br>"To read James K. Galbraith is to think afresh, and at the same time to reconcile oneself with reality.

It is therefore critical that healthcare providers who interact with seriously ill patients know how to address their spiritual needs.<br><br> This book presents current thinking on how spiritual care can be integrated into traditional caregiving. Part one discusses aspects of spirituality, such as presence, ethics, and relationships. Part two delves into a number of specific religious and theological traditions.

Today, the museum that bears his name&#x2015;Baltimore's Walters Art Gallery&#x2015;excels in fields as diverse as Egyptian bronzes, Byzantine silver, illuminated manuscripts, medieval carved ivories, early Renaissance paintings, S�vres porcelains, Islamic metalwork, and Chinese ceramics. Surprisingly, the story of how William Walters and his son Henry created one of the finest privately assembled museums in the United States has not been told.</p><p>With this new book, William Johnston, the Walters's curator of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century art, restores William and Henry Walters to their rightful place among America's great art collectors. Drawing upon the knowledge of the early museum staff and gathering valuable information from the few other available sources, Johnston has painstakingly recreated the life and world of the Walterses.</p><p>Though Henry Walters moved easily in Baltimore and New York social circles, Johnston explains, he kept much to himself and generally purchased art away from the public's eye. Despite the Walterses' reticence, they had a significant influence on the development of American tastes and museums&#x2015;William in his role as the first chairman of the Committee on Works of Art for the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., and Henry as the second vice-president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Their personal collection differs from those of other, more familiar collectors, such as J. P. Morgan and Henry Clay Frick, in that Henry Walters intended from the very first that the collection form a museum to serve the public. When the museum first opened its doors in 1934, Johnston relates, many visitors were surprised by the collection's size and by its comprehensive representation of the history of art from the third millennium b.c. to the early twentieth century. </p><p>Richly illustrated with black-and-white photographs and sixteen pages of full color, this book will fascinate anyone interested in Baltimore history, the history of museums and art collecting in America, and the art and culture of nineteenth-century America. </p></p><p><p>The story of the father and son who created the extraordinary collection that became Baltimore's Walters Art Gallery. </p><p><b>William R.

It is Davies&#39; best-known novel, and considered his finest.</p><p><b><i>Fifth Business</i> Reading Group Guide:</b> <br><br> <b>INTRODUCTION</b><br> "We move through a throng of Sleeping Princesses, Belles Dames sans merci, Cinderellas, Wicked Witches, Powerful Wizards, Frog Princes, Lucky Third Sons, Ogres, Dwarves, Sagacious Animal Helpers and Servers, yes and Heroes and Heroines, in a world that is nothing less than an enchanted landscape."<br> &#x2014;Robertson Davies <p> Myth, magic, and miracles, freaks, saints, and devils--such is the world of wonders unleashed by a simple snowball thrown in the village of Deptford in 1908. </p><p> <b>Fifth Business</b> is Davies's masterwork, the book that cemented his reputation as one of the great storytellers of our time. When the book appeared in 1970, he had already published the three books of his <b>Salterton Trilogy</b>, which won him recognition in his native Canada as an incisive cultural critic and an endlessly entertaining novelist. He had struck a note near Mark Twain in his portrayal of small-town culture, satirizing the residents' pious absurdities without seeming cruel, dramatizing their dreams and good intentions without becoming sentimental. </p><p> With <b>Fifth Business</b>, he plumbed new artistic and spiritual depths. The opening scene, which he envisioned taking place at his boyhood home in Thamesville, Ontario, haunted Davies from the first time it appeared to him in about 1960 until he began to draft the novel ten years later: "It was simply a scene that kept occurring in my mind, which was of two boys on a village street on a winter night--I knew from the look of the atmosphere that it must be just around Christmas-time--and one boy threw a snowball at the other boy. Well, that was all there was to it, but it came so often and was so insistent that I had to ask myself, Why is that boy doing that and what is behind this and what is going on?" </p><p> Many elements of the novel that emerged from this vision were drawn from Davies's early childhood. Like Dunstable Ramsay's father, Davies's father was the one-man publisher of a village newspaper, and Davies grew up in the newspaper business. "In a newspaper family," he said, "you learn not only all the news that's fit to print, but all the news that is not fit to print, and you acquire an insight into human nature and the essence of a community which is very hard to acquire . . . in any other way." </p><p> Like his protagonist in <b>Fifth Business</b>, Davies was raised in the Presbyterian Church. Although he eventually rejected its particular doctrines, he retained a strongly religious temperament. His spiritual explorations ultimately found resonance in the works of Carl Gustav Jung. "Orthodox Christianity has always had for me the difficulty that it really won't come . . . to grips with the problem of evil," Davies said. "What looks good can be pushed to the point that it becomes evil, and . . . evil very frequently bears what can only be regarded as good fruit." Jung had portrayed God as a psychological reality that embraced polarities of good and evil, light and shadow; the devil is an inextricable part of him. One had to confront this shadow face-to-face in order to live a moral life. "The devil is the unexamined side of life," Davies said, "and the great evils spring from acting without knowledge of your subconscious intentions." </p><p> Davies was also drawn to Jung's deities because they had womanly as well as manly faces, faces that are reflected in his portrayal of Mary Dempster. Here were the feminine elements he found woefully lacking in Christianity, with its focus on God the Father and the Son. In Jung's landscape of the psyche, Davies found a theoretical grounding for the diverse representations of human quest and conflict he had come to appreciate. Beyond the Judeo-Christian literary tradition was a rich world of folk tales, myths, ghost stories, and legends that were sacred in their own way, striking deep spiritual chords in our unconscious. From this same sensibility sprang Davies's lifelong interest in saints, which he, like Ramsay, appreciated not as narrowly defined religious figures, but as archetypes of universal characters and tales. </p><p> The remarkable events that unfold in this "enchanted landscape" owe much to Davies's lifelong love of the theater. From boyhood he was drawn to the traveling circus, the magic show, and the movie palace. Over the course of his career he worked for the Old Vic Repertory Company in London, wrote a dozen plays, and was one of the founders of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. His passion for theater was so intense that his novels have sometimes been criticized for their theatricality: How does Ramsay just happen to meet Paul Dempster repeatedly in his travels, and how does Surgeoner "randomly" pick Ramsay from the crowd at Colborne College? But such theatrical events--call them coincidence or fate--lie at the heart of Davies's worldview. "I'm not in any way a devotee of realism," said Davies, "and the theatre is never realistic, even when it's pretending to be intensely so." The meaningful stories in our lives are dramatic rather than naturalistic, remarkable rather than random. </p><p> This appreciation of the theater of the inner life could come only with age. Davies was in his fifties when he explored these demons of youth in <b>Fifth Business</b>, and the result is a captivating narrative stance. While working on the manuscript, he wrote, "It is autobiographical, but not as young men would do it; it will be rather as Dickens wrote <b>David Copperfield</b>--a fictional reworking of some things experienced and much rearranged--a spiritual autobiography in fact, and not a sweating account of the first time I backed a girl into a corner." Davies's protagonist frequently distances himself from immediate events, adding the tincture of age and humor to vividly recalled experience. </p><p>The unforgettable tone that arises from this perspective has been characterized as a hybrid of satire and romance. Davies somehow manages to marry these seemingly incompatible viewpoints, delighting in his own former naivet� and the follies of his youth while maintaining a fundamental earnestness about Ramsay's aspirations. It is the voice of a man at mid-life who has taken unusual paths, who is fascinated by the possibilities that lie before him, and who has lost neither his youthful seriousness nor his sense of humor. </p><p> Despite his established reputation in Canada, Davies was little known to U.S. readers and reviewers when <b>Fifth Business</b> was published in 1970. The American reception was exuberant, propelling the novel to bestseller lists in both the U.S. and Canada. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt described it in the <b>New York Times</b> as "a marvelously enigmatic novel . . . elegantly written and driven by irresistible narrative. One thinks of <b>The Magic Mountain</b> and <b>The French Lieutenant's Woman</b>, although Mr. Davies hardly needs Thomas Mann and John Fowles to prop him up." </p><p> Other reviewers praised the remarkable range of erudition he conveys in his works. Saints and card tricks, brandy and psychology, linguistics and bearded ladies are all objects of his insatiable curiosity. Davies is modest about the range of his learning, pointing out that some academics thought Shakespeare must have been a sailor because of the convincing seaman's slang in <b>The Tempest</b>: "It's all hooey. Shakespeare had a few telling details which he injected into his plays that made them seem realistic, and I have the same in my novels." A veteran once asked Davies where he had served in France during the Great War, for only a soldier could have captured the mud and panic of the trenches so vividly. Davies had to reply that he was in the cradle at the time. Similarly, his fictional prescription for bringing an ailing cello back to its true voice with a poultice of horse manure was pure fancy. Even the definition of "<b>Fifth Business</b>" that opens the book&#x2014;cited from a dull, untranslated account of Danish theater and first taken as yet another example of Davies's eccentric knowledge&#x2014;was revealed to be entirely fictional when the Norwegian edition of the book was published (although the notion it conveys of "<b>Fifth Business</b>" in the theater is quite accurate). </p><p> The key is to be convincing, true to the spirit rather than to mere facts. As Davies described the art of writing: </p><p> If you're a writer . . . you're a descendent of those medieval storytellers who used to go into the square of a town and spread a little mat on the ground and sit on it and beat on a bowl and say, 'If you give me a copper coin I will tell you a golden tale.' If the storyteller had what it took, he . . . told them a golden tale until it got to the most exciting point and then he passed the bowl again. </p><p> His storytelling prowess earned him frequent comparisons to Charles Dickens--a comparison of which he was not overly fond. The authors he admired included Victor Hugo, Honore de Balzac, Anthony Trollope, Evelyn Waugh, and Daniel Defoe, all very different writers, but all possessing what he called shamanstvo--the enchanter quality, from the word shaman. Like Dickens, Davies had a flair for the dramatic and could sketch a secondary character unforgettably in just a few lines (the portraits of Rev. Leadbeater, Orph Wettenhall, and Boy's stepdaughter Lorene in <b>Fifth Business</b>, for example). But he was more daring in his experiments with form than he is often given credit for, and his novelistic objectives are decidedly modern rather than Victorian. </p><p> As Michiko Kakutani wrote in the <b>New York Times</b>, Davies "has created a rich oeuvre of densely plotted, highly symbolic novels that not only function as superbly funny entertainments but also give the reader, in his character's words, a deeper kind of pleasure&#x2014; delight, awe, religious intimations, a fine sense of the past, and of the boundless depth and variety of life." </p><p> <b>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</b><br><br> 1. When Percy Boyd Staunton denies his share of responsibility for the snowball that hit Mrs. Dempster and caused her premature labor, Dunstable Ramsay feels the full weight of guilt on his shoulders. Even years later, when he seeks out Mrs. Dempster again, he is highly sensitive to the magistrate's charge: <b>"Guilt . . . somebody bears it to this day!"</b> Why does he feel this guilt so keenly? To what extent is he responsible for Paul's fate? For Staunton's?<br><br> 2. Many of the characters in <b>Fifth Business</b> change their names. Dunstable Ramsay becomes Dunstan, Percy Boyd Staunton becomes Boy Staunton, Paul Dempster becomes Faustus Legrand and later Magnus Eisengrim. What happens when each of them is "born again"? Which aspects of their characters endure, and which are transformed? <br><br> 3. Young Dunstable's flight from his mother colors the rest of his life. When he contemplates his relationship with Diana, his first lover, he shuns the motherly quality of her affection: <b>"I had no intention of being anyone's dear laddie, ever again."</b> How and why do the other men in the novel (Boy Staunton, Paul Dempster) flee their mothers? What are they seeking in a woman? How are the ideal and the reality of motherhood and womanhood conveyed in Ramsay's reflections on the virgin Mary? <br><br> 4. "People marry most happily with their own kind," Davies once wrote. "The trouble lies in the fact that people usually marry at an age where they do not really know what their own kind is." What would have happened if Dunstan had married Leola? What kind of marriage would have better suited Boy?<br><br> </p><p>5. <b>"If you think her a saint, she is a saint to you,"</b> says Padre Blazon of Ramsay's fascination with Mary Dempster. What place does she come to occupy in his psychological landscape? Why is he so possessive of her, refusing to ask for Boy's assistance for her care? <br><br> 6. King Edward VIII of England was forced to abdicate in 1936 after less than a year in office because he wanted to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American who was felt to be an unacceptable Queen. Why was this such a bitter blow to Boy? What did Edward represent to him? 7. If Ramsay is truly "<b>Fifth Business</b>," as Liesl describes, who are the hero and heroine, sorceress, and villain of the story? Do they correspond to the "<b>usual cabal</b>" described at the book's conclusion? Who are "<b>the Basso and the Brazen Head</b>" Liesl refers to in her letter? Who was the woman Boy knew and the woman he didn't know? <br><br> 8. Ganymede was a beautiful Trojan prince who was seized and carried to Olympus by Zeus's eagle to become the cup-bearer of the gods. Ramsay suggests that Boy's corporate proteges were expected to fill that role. What did he want from them, and why did they always disappoint him? <br><br> 9. "I seem to have emerged as a moralist; my novels are a moralist's novels," Davies said of his work. Certainly they are not moralistic in a conventional religious sense. In what sense are they moralistic? Ramsay tells Boy, <b>"You created a God in your own image, and when you found out he was no good you abolished him. It's a quite common form of psychological suicide."</b> What kind of God has Ramsay set up for himself? What light is shed on his moral character by his discussions of the devil? His talk with Surgeoner about fictional testimonials? <br><br> 10. <b>Fifth Business</b> has sometimes been read as an allegory of Canada's struggle for recognition and identity. Who do you think plays the part of the U. S. in this interpretation? What devils might Canada have to address to develop fully as a nation?</p><b>Robertson Davies</b> (1913&#x2013;1995) was born and raised in Ontario, and was educated at a variety of schools, including Upper Canada College, Queen&#x2019;s University, and Balliol College, Oxford.

Pure War described the invisible war waged by technology against humanity, and the lack of any real distinction since World War II between war and peace. Speaking with Lotringer in 1982, Virilio noted the &#x201c;accidents&#x201d; that inevitably arise with every technological development: from car crashes to nuclear spillage, to the extermination of space and the derealization of time wrought by instant communication. In this new and updated edition, Virilio and Lotringer consider how the omnipresent threat of the &#x201c;accident&#x201d;&#x2015;both military and economic&#x2015;has escalated. With the fall of the Soviet bloc, the balance of power between East and West based on nuclear deterrence has given way to a more diffuse multi-polar nuclear threat. Moreover, as the speed of communication has increased exponentially, &#x201c;local&#x201d; accidents&#x2015;like the collapse of the Asian markets in the late 1980s&#x2015;escalate, with the speed of contagion, into global events instantaneously. &#x201c;Globalization,&#x201d; Virilio argues, is the planet's ultimate accident.Paul Virilio was born in Paris in 1932 to an immigrant Italian family. Trained as an urban planner, he became the director of the �cole Speciale d'Architecture in the wake of the 1968 rebellion.

Now the <i>New York Times</i> writes that her canvases--multilayered, futuristic visual worlds where historical and fictional landscapes meet--"make history painting important again." Each one pulls from diverse sources, noteworthy among them Japanese manga, Chinese landscape art, Ethiopian illuminated books, Baroque engraving in the style of D�rer, graffiti and the geometric abstractions of Kazimir Malevich and Vasily Kandinsky. And they are often structured on architectural drawing, which appeals to Mehretu "because there is no way that you could make architecture that doesn't work." Plans for buildings are metaphors "for systems, for rational efforts to construct the world that we exist within, even though so many things happen in a very organic or irrational way." These angular architectural spaces swarm with organic forms, with communities marching to war, confronting systems and creating elaborate new civilizations. Human relationships unfold, interacting with the built and controlled world. Of her interest in these warring factions and in the "aggressive and forceful nature of history," Mehretu says that, "most of my personal ancestry comes from different cultures that, at one time or another, were at war." This is the first comprehensive monograph on a strong new talent in contemporary painting.</p><p></p><h2>Treating Child &amp; Adolescent Mental Illness: A Practical, All-in-One Guide</h2><p><p><strong>Fifteen million children in the U.S. have diagnosable psychiatric or learning disorders, yet nearly 70% don&#x2019;t receive the help they need.</strong></p> Indeed, the number of practitioners trained in treating children and adolescents falls far short of what&#x2019;s called for.

Dr. Jess Shatkin has written a book that should be read and mastered by anyone who wishes to provide state-of-the-art mental health care for children, adolescents, and families.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Harold S. Koplewicz, MD, Founder and Director, NYU Child Study Center</strong><br><br>&#x201c;The book that I wish I had written. Fact-based and supported by references, this comprehensive, practical, and user-friendly text is a must-read for all child mental health practitioners (whether in practice or in training), parents of children and adolescents, and the general public as well. Dr. Shatkin&#x2019;s knowledge, wealth of clinical and teaching experience, and sensitivity to children, families, and the developmental process make this book different: a truly unique and original contribution.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Thomas F. Anders, MD, Distinguished Professor (Emeritus), University of California, Davis Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and M.I.N.D.

Copeland goes on to analyze what those working in AI must achieve before they can claim to have built a thinking machine and appraises their prospects of succeeding. <p>There are clear introductions to connectionism and to the language of thought hypothesis which weave together material from philosophy, artificial intelligence and neuroscience. John Searle's attacks on AI and cognitive science are countered and close attention is given to foundational issues, including the nature of computation, Turing Machines, the Church-Turing Thesis and the difference between classical symbol processing and parallel distributed processing. The book also explores the possibility of machines having free will and consciousness and concludes with a discussion of in what sense the human brain may be a computer.</p></p><p><b>Jack Copeland</b> is Senior Lecturer in philosophy and logic at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand.

The Scientific Buddha was sent into battle against Christian missionaries, who were proclaiming across Asia that Buddhism was a form of superstition. He proved the missionaries wrong, teaching a dharma that was in harmony with modern science. And&nbsp;his influence continues. Today his teaching of "mindfulness" is heralded&nbsp;as the cure for all manner of maladies, from depression to high blood pressure.</p><p>In this potent critique, a well-known&nbsp;chronicler of the West's encounter with Buddhism demonstrates how the Scientific Buddha's teachings deviate in crucial ways from those of the far older Buddha of ancient India. Donald Lopez shows that the Western focus on the Scientific Buddha threatens to bleach Buddhism of its vibrancy, complexity, and power, even as the superficial focus on "mindfulness" turns Buddhism into merely the latest self-help movement. The Scientific Buddha has served his purpose, Lopez argues. It is now time for him to pass into nirvana. This is not to say, however, that the teachings of the ancient Buddha must be dismissed as mere cultural artifacts. They continue to present a&nbsp;potent challenge, even to our modern world.</p></p><p><p><b>Donald S. Lopez, Jr.</b> is Arthur E.

But the book is much more than a critique of slipshod appropriations or representations of Buddhism; Lopez goes on to argue that the real contribution of Buddhism may lie precisely in its&nbsp;critique&nbsp;of contemporary scientific hubris.

Based on the latest scholarship and richly illustrated, it is the most authoritative and accessible chronicle of the Jewish experience available. Michael Brenner tells a dramatic story of change and migration deeply rooted in tradition, taking readers from the mythic wanderings of Moses to the unspeakable atrocities of the Holocaust; from the Babylonian exile to the founding of the modern state of Israel; and from the Sephardic communities under medieval Islam to the shtetls of eastern Europe and the Hasidic enclaves of modern-day Brooklyn. The book is full of fascinating personal stories of exodus and return, from that told about Abraham, who brought his newfound faith into Canaan, to that of Holocaust survivor Esther Barkai, who lived on a kibbutz established on a German estate seized from the Nazi Julius Streicher as she awaited resettlement in Israel. Describing the events and people that have shaped Jewish history, and highlighting the important contributions Jews have made to the arts, politics, religion, and science, <i>A Short History of the Jews</i> is a compelling blend of storytelling and scholarship that brings the Jewish past marvelously to life.</p></p><p><p>"Drawing on the best recent scholarship and wearing his formidable learning lightly, Michael Brenner has produced a remarkable synoptic survey of Jewish history.

A man of average income feels he cannot be truly happy unless he owns an expensive luxury car. A dieter has an irresistible craving for ice cream. Desires often come to us unbidden and unwanted, and they can have a dramatic impact, sometimes changing the course of our lives.<br><br> In <em>On Desire</em>, William B. Irvine takes us on a wide-ranging tour of our impulses, wants, and needs, showing us where these feelings come from and how we can try to rein them in. Spicing his account with engaging observations by writers like Seneca, Tolstoy, and Freud, Irvine considers the teachings of Buddhists, Hindus, the Amish, Shakers, and Catholic saints, as well as those of ancient Greek and Roman and modern European philosophers. Irvine also looks at what modern science can tell us about desire--what happens in the brain when we desire something and how animals evolved particular desires--and he advances a new theory about how desire itself evolved. Irvine also suggests that at the same time that we gained the ability to desire, we were "programmed" to find some things more desirable than others. Irvine concludes that the best way to attain lasting happiness is not to change the world around us or our place in it, but to change ourselves. If we can convince ourselves to want what we already have, we can dramatically enhance our happiness.<br><br> Brimming with wisdom and practical advice, <em>On Desire</em> offers a thoughtful approach to controlling unwanted passions and attaining a more meaningful life.</p><p><br><strong>William B. Irvine</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at Wright State University, in Dayton, Ohio.<br><br>"A sprightly and entertaining book.... Those who would like to understand and control some of their desires will be glad to find this book on the library shelf."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"What is delightful about this book is that the usual suspects are not as conspicuous. Instead, the Shakers are discussed alongside Buddha, and Diogenes adjacent to Thoreau.... With clear writing, backed up by careful exegesis and a unique twist to a common thesis, this work is necessary for most undergraduate collections, and for students of philosophy and happiness. Summing Up: Highly recommended."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"William B. Irvine has written a disarmingly seductive and easily readable treatise on the origins, nature, vicissitudes, and 'crises' of desire. He simply and clearly discusses biologically instilled incentive systems, the rich psychological research on the peculiarities of our motivation, and the wisdom of various religious and spiritual traditions. It is a well-informed, wise, informal interdisciplinary book that is highly recommended for the general reader."--Robert C. Solomon, author of <em>The Passions, About Love, The Joy of Philosophy, Not Passion's Slave</em>, and <em>In Defense of</em> <em>Sentimentality</em><p></p><br>"Irvine has given us a very engaging book on what desire is: how central it is to human existence, what science has to tell us about it, and what we can do with it and about it. He combines knowledge, wisdom and wit with a light but sure philosophical touch."--John Perry, Professor of Philosophy, Stanford University<p></p><br>"...a sweeping review of philosophical, psychological, evolutionary, and religious concepts of desire.

The effort to contain the growing influence of the Soviet Union resulted in the Cold War, a conflict that emphasized the American commitment to freedom. The absence of that freedom for nonwhite American citizens confronted the nation's leaders with an embarrassing contradiction. </p><p>Racial discrimination after 1945 was a foreign as well as a domestic problem.

America's closest allies against the Soviet Union, however, were colonial powers whose interests had to be balanced against those of the emerging independent Third World in a multiracial, anticommunist alliance. At the same time, U.S. racial reform was essential to preserve the domestic consensus needed to sustain the Cold War struggle.</p><p><i>The Cold War and the Color Line</i> is the first comprehensive examination of how the Cold War intersected with the final destruction of global white supremacy. Thomas Borstelmann pays close attention to the two Souths--Southern Africa and the American South--as the primary sites of white authority's last stand. He reveals America's efforts to contain the racial polarization that threatened to unravel the anticommunist western alliance. In so doing, he recasts the history of American race relations in its true international context, one that is meaningful and relevant for our own era of globalization.</p></p><p>Thomas Borstelmann is Elwood N. and Katherine Thompson Distinguished Professor of Modern World History, University of Nebraska.In rich, informing detail enlivened with telling anecdote, Cornell historian Borstelmann unites under one umbrella two commonly separated strains of the U.S. post-WWII experience: our domestic political and cultural history, where the Civil Rights movement holds center stage, and our foreign policy, where the Cold War looms largest. After moving swiftly from a 19th century where white consolidation of dominion in the American South and West coincides with Europe's conquest of Africa, and through a Second World War where German prisoners of war are better treated than black soldiers, Borstelmann follows "the nexus of race and foreign relations" through successive administrations as the Cold War develops. Readers deeply familiar with the history of race in America or American foreign policy history may find little that is news here, but by placing the Ole Miss debacle in an international context, or the Marshall Plan in a racial context; by juxtaposing the Bandung Conference and Brown v. Board of Education; by positioning a Selma, March 7, next to the March 8 arrival of marines at Danang, Borstelmann shifts the lens through which we view both the Cold War and the civil rights movement, revealing something new and provocative: the extent to which "domestic and foreign policies regarding people of color developed as two sides of the same coin" and "how those racial lenses helped shape U.S. relations with the outside world in the era of American dominance in the international sphere." No history could be more timely or more cogent. This densely detailed book, wide ranging in its sources, contains lessons that could play a vital role in reshaping American foreign and domestic policy. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Kumon Grade 5 Decimals &amp; Fractions (Kumon Math Workbooks)</h2><p>Most grade-school workbooks try to cover the full range of topics in one workbook, and as a result do not dedicate enough pages to important mathematical concepts.

Harris's concise introductory overview surveys Brazil's different regions with their different ethnic mixes and sorts out the major elements--indigenous, Portuguese (and through them, Moorish), African, and others--in this lively melting-pot cuisine. Her useful list of foreign- sounding ingredients includes several available at Latin American and Caribbean markets and a few unavailable to us. Brazilian cooking, and thus these recipes, makes heavy use of cassava, fresh and dried shrimp, peanuts, banana leaves, coconut milk, dende (palm) oil, hot malagueta chiles (often preserved according to a recipe Harris provides), and various tropical fruits. The more exotic recipes include drinks made from cacha&#x2021;a (an alcoholic sugar-cane product), unusual sweet snacks, spicy condiments, typical Bahian black-eyed-pea fritters, and two versions of the Brazilian national dish feijoada--that elaborate smoked-meat and black-bean feast that unfortunately requires carne seca (a salted, sun-dried meat peculiar to Brazil). Some of the other dishes can be prepared with items from your local supermarket, but you'll definitely want to range further afield. As presented here, a Brazilian spread would make for a memorable informal party. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Brazil is better known for its beaches, festivals and rain forests than for its food. Moreover, claims food and travel writer Harris ( Iron Pots and Wooden Spoons ), the nation's "supercosmopolitan cities, Rio and Sao Paulo . . . have been so influenced by tourism and by the tastes of the rich that it is only by staying a while and scratching the surface that the visitor can see what the food is really like." Unearthing the best from what she calls "the land of meat and potatoes" here brings rewards: such characteristically Brazilian specialties as a chili and lime sauce, and several versions of malagueta pepper sauce, serve as the complements to the grilled meats and fish that form the basis of Brazilian cooking. A selection of fancifully named, luscious sweets include avocado ice cream (in Brazil, the avocado most frequently appears as a dessert) and a confection known as "maiden's drool" because, according to the author, the dessert so tempts young girls that they "drool with delight." Fruity cocktails appear as well. Harris reflects her knowledge of both Brazilian and American markets with a lengthy list of unusual ingredients, and provides substitutions for supersaturated but taste-laden palm oil, as familiar to Brazilian cooking as the ubiquitous malagueta pepper, but repellent to health-conscious Americans. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion</h2><p><p>Originally published in 1983, Leo Steinberg's classic work has changed the viewing habits of a generation. After centuries of repression and censorship, the sexual component in thousands of revered icons of Christ is restored to visibility. Steinberg's evidence resides in the imagery of the overtly sexed Christ, in Infancy and again after death. Steinberg argues that the artists regarded the deliberate exposure of Christ's genitalia as an affirmation of kinship with the human condition. Christ's lifelong virginity, understood as potency under check, and the first offer of blood in the circumcision, both required acknowledgment of the genital organ. More than exercises in realism, these unabashed images underscore the crucial theological import of the Incarnation. <br> <br> This revised and greatly expanded edition not only adduces new visual evidence, but deepens the theological argument and engages the controversy aroused by the book's first publication.<br> <br></p></p><p><p><b>Leo Steinberg</b> (1920-2011)&nbsp;was the Benjamin Franklin Professor Emeritus of the History of Art at the University of Pennsylvania.</p></p><h2>The Psychology of Wealth: Understand Your Relationship with Money and Achieve Prosperity</h2><p><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> and <i>Wall Street Journal</i> bestseller!</b></p> <p>&#x201c;<i>The Psychology of Wealth</i> is a pertinent and comprehensive overview of the skills and mindset necessary for success.

It is what makes them useful, able and beautiful. A foal can walk, trot and gallop within hours of its birth. The horse knows how to be a horse without human help. But when we ride, drive, train and judge horses, we soon discover that not all horses move equally well. Even though there are over two hundred breeds and types of horses and many different disciplines and styles of riding, the horse's basic mechanism and nature are the same. At the heart of Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement is what is natural and common to all breeds, and herein lies the broadness of this book's appeal to riders, instructors, trainers and judges?anyone concerned with equine movement. Lifelong horsewoman Susan E. Harris addresses in her writing and in her more than 300 superb drawings?which demonstrate the kind of nuance and detail photographs do not permit?the following topics:<ul><li>basic structure and anatomy</li><li>the cycle of movement</li><li>gaits and transitions</li><li>balance and movement</li><li>poor movement</li><li>flexion, bending and lateral movement</li><li>conformation and movement</li><li>shoeing and movement</li><li>how a rider affects movement.</li></ul>Her chapter on practical tips for improving the horse's movement will be especially valuable to the rider, whether he or she is in reining, show jumping or dressage.

In the tradition of Rudyard Kipling and A.A. Milne, Paul Adshead writes with great respect for a child's ability to appreciate and enjoy the intricacies of the English language. Puzzle Island is an invitation to communication and interaction with others. It is as much a social tool as it is an intellectual challenge. It brings together people of many different ages and interests and promises opportunities for discovery for all!</p>When asked to write a brief autobiographical account of how I came to be so interested in art, music and wildlife, I found myself faced with a problem. Most people would be able to list their achievements or qualifications, and mention how and where they had trained. I can no none of this, having no training or qualifications at all. On reflection, it seems that various circumstances and events during my childhood have shaped my life. <p>When I was young, my father would tell me a different story every night, improvised on any subject I chose. Perhaps this has led to my own fondness of telling stories. So here is another story - not an imaginary story this time, but a true one... </p><p>One of my earliest childhood memories is of being ill in bed with the measles. To keep me amused, my mother would sit on the bed and draw pictures for me to colour. I can still recall the picture on one particular day. A weasell sat on a log, surrounded by mounts of autumn leaves and conkers. Proud of the finished result, mother asked if there was anything else I would like as a special present to cheer me up. Without a moments hesitation, I replied, "A tortoise". </p><p>Although the request was not quite what she had expected, my very first pet arrived later that afternoon and was given the name of Fred! I remember being fascinated by his every movement, especially his trick of being able to withdraw into his shell. He was later joined by a rabbit, and the three of us would go on picnics together. They were happy, carefree days, but they came to a sudden end when it was time to start school. </p><p>Up till that time I had spent very little time with other children; always preferring my own company and that of various little creature I adopted. Only a few days after starting school, something happened that has probably affected me ever since. During my walk home, which took me down a long, narrow lane, an older schoolboy chased after me brandishing a knife, shouting that he was going to kill me. Even now I can hear the pounding of his footsteps behind me as I raced towards home. I had no desire to ever return to school again, but of course I had no choice. In an attempt to rectify matters, the headmaster paraded me through every classroom until I found the culprit. But instead of solving the problem, this only served to isolate me further from all the other children. From hen on I was a marked person, often I would arrive in the morning to find my books torn and my desk upside-down. Just like the tortoise, I began to withdraw into my shell. More and more I came to appreciate any time I could spend alone. </p><p>At six and a half years old, I acquired my first pair of walking boots. They had animal footprints on the soles, and each one had a tiny pocket in the heel to hide a sixpense, in case of emergency. So, suitably shod, with my precious binoculars around my neck, and sketchpad and pencil in my pocket, I would spend many happy hours on nature rambles with my Uncle and Aunt. </p><p>I remember walking to "secret places" in the wood to feed the squirrels. I had a pocket full of peanuts, and the long tailed tits, nuthatches and chaffinches would fly down to my hand to take them. </p><p>Another day in the forest we fed all our sandwiches to a herd of fallow deer. Then later we were so hungry we ate the wild black cherries growing along the lane. </p><p>Returning home I would spend hours making detailed drawings of the creature s I had seen. More often than not, 'dressing them up' in imaginary outfits of clothing. More an more I would daydream in a fantasy world of little creatures to escape the reality of an unhappy school life. </p><p>From early on I had earned the nickname 'Birdboy', because of being more familiar with the names of feathered friends than my so-called school friends. My school report that year proved true indeed. It said 'Paul's artwork is very promising, but he finds it difficult to make friends."<br> As I grew older, my collection of pets gradually increased. Several rabbits, guinea pigs, mice, gerbils, a budgerigar, and a duck, along with any orphaned or injured wild birds I happened to find.<br> About this time, I began to take an interest in music, and started piano lessons. I took to it immediately, and a few months after beginning to learn, I composed my first piece of music 'Waltz in F'. </p><p>It was very interesting for me to find something that could give me so much pleasure. My mind became filled with music, and nothing satisfied me more than the composition of a new etude or nocturn. Every single afternoon I would rush home from school, and sit straight down at the piano not even pausing to remove my coat. Then without stopping I would play for an hour or more until all thoughts of school had left me and I felt relaxed once more. </p><p>The following five years in senior school were no happier. I lived for the time when I would be able to leave. Finally I opted to leave six months early, taking only my final exams in Art an English. Although I took both of these exams my papers were somehow lost. I always thought that I was a ploy to force me to stay on at school longer, but my mind was made up. I left school without any regrets, but also without any qualifications what so ever. </p><p>My first job was in a gift shop. This gradually got me used to being with other people and began to undo some of the ill effects of years earlier. My bird collection increased further with the addition of several pairs of ducks, some rare breeds of poultry, peacocks and my most loyal companion of all - Toby, a yorkshire terrier. His delightful personality and gentleness with all the other creatures inspired me to begin writing short stories and verses to accompany the pictures I still painted of them all. </p><p>So a few years later when the shop closed down, I decided not to seek reemployment immediately, but to take writing and illustrating more seriously and seek publication.<br> But that is quite another story..........</p></p><h2>British Modern: Graphic Design between the Wars</h2><p>The newest addition to the Art Deco series, <i>British Modern</i> is the first to focus on Great Britain's contribution. An essential resource for graphic artists, designers, and anyone interested in advertising or art history, <i>British Modern</i> contains over 200 reproductions of classic Art Deco work from the 20s, 30s, and early 40s. Here are RAF posters, cigarette packages, post office greeting cards, <i>Vogue</i> magazine covers, travel promotionals, ads for London nightclubs, and other examples of Deco style. Some of the best pieces turn up in the most unlikely places -- the tiny packages in which razors were sold, for example, yield an impressive display of bold and beautiful Deco artistry. Copious inspiration for designer or artist, <i>British Modern</i> also presents a novel portrait of English life in the first half of the 20th century.</p><p>If Britain surprises you as a source of graphic innovation, think of those posters from the 1920s and '30s promoting London's new subway system, The Underground--the bold red circle with the horizontal slash set in some futurist illustration of urbanity. It's true that England was slow to accept modernism as a vehicle for advertising British goods and industry. While France, Germany, and the U.S. were leaving decorative ornament behind in favor of more bold, industrial, and progressive techniques, English graphic artists held fast to their late-19th-century traditions. But not for long. By the 1920s, young English designers had not only accepted the methods of the Continent, but had made them their own. With the support of British trade and marketing organizations, English posters, packaging, typography, and book designs won international recognition.<p> The Underground posters are some of the most famous, but they are by no means the only remarkable images to come from this period. <i>British Modern: Graphic Design Between the Wars</i> collects what the authors call "the masterpieces of function and simplicity that characterize the best of the modern as well as the excessive concoctions that evolved or devolved." Constructivist-influenced covers of <i>The Rag Rag</i> magazine; flat, rich color fields of Austin Reed and Kestos clothing advertisements; and heavy-handed, austere wartime propaganda posters are just a few of the hundreds of illustrations that make this book a useful reference for anyone interested in design. The book's horizontal format allows for many images to fit on a page, but it works against the full-page illustrations, which tend to bleed off the page. The text is short, readable, and best of all, very informative, explaining the history, trends, and exhibitions that contributed to Britain's particular surge in creative activity. <i>--Manine Golden</i></p>Steven Heller is the art director of the New York Times Book Review.

It presents the history, taxonomy, nomenclature, culture, and propagation of Acer palmatum and Acer japonicum and illustrates hundreds of wonderful varieties of these versatile trees and shrubs.</p><p>This third edition of the classic book on Japanese maples is certain to attract new converts to these superior garden trees. When the first edition of this book by J. D. Vertrees appeared in 1978, there had been no definitive text in English describing them in detail; these trees were the province of specialists only, and few even knew their correct names. Today, Japanese maples are found in nearly every garden center; many new varieties are bred and introduced each year. The inclusion of these new varieties, together with updated information on plant names which renders obsolete some names in the previous editions, makes this new update by Peter Gregory an indispensable reference. With their remarkable diversity of color, form, and texture, Japanese maples are unlike any other kind of garden tree. The shapes and patterns of Japanese maple leaves, in particular, can defy the imagination. Resulting from hundreds of years of careful breeding and observation by Japanese horticulturists and their western counterparts, these maples are aristocratic trees and shrubs destined to be specimen plants in any garden in which they are found. <p>Approximately 100 new cultivated varieties (cultivars) have been added to this edition, resulting in descriptions of more than 400 cultivars in all. With 313 color photographs, this book includes 60 more photos than the previous edition. Modern methods of color reproduction and printing have allowed sharper, more accurate versions of Vertrees&#x2019;s original photos to aid the gardener in identification and selection. </p><p>With comprehensive and practical information on growing Japanese maples well, this book will appeal to gardeners at every level.</p>J. D. Vertrees (1915-1993) was probably the most knowledgeable grower of Japanese maples in his time, and amassed at Maplewood Nursery in southern Oregon the largest collection of Japanese maples in the United States.</p><h2>Experimental Design for the Life Sciences</h2><p>At the core of good research lies the careful design of experiments. However, all too often a successful design comes only after a painful trial-and-error process that wastes valuable time and resources.<br><br>Now in a new edition, <em>Experimental Design for the Life Sciences</em> teaches today's students how to effectively design experiments, equipping them with the skills they need to become tomorrow's top researchers. Employing a refreshingly approachable and articulate style, the text explains the essential elements of experimental design in clear, practical terms, so that students can grasp and apply even the most challenging concepts, including power analysis and pseudoreplication. In addition, it emphasizes the interrelatedness of experimental design, statistics, and ethical considerations throughout. A broad range of examples--drawn from the primary literature and the authors' extensive personal experience--demonstrate the practical relevance of experimental design in real-life biological research.<br><br>The only undergraduate text devoted to this topic, <em>Experimental Design for the Life Sciences,</em> Third Edition, demonstrates how good experimental design relies on clear thinking and biological understanding, not on mathematical or statistical complexity.<br><br><strong>Pedagogical Features</strong><br><br>* Self-test questions, with answers at the end of the book, reinforce essential facts and encourage students to check their understanding as they progress<br><br>* Take-home messages throughout chapters focus students' attention on the principles that they must master<br><br>* Coverage of ethical issues, flagged in the margins, raises awareness of this important aspect of the field</p><p><br><strong>Graeme Ruxton</strong> obtained a first degree in Physics before getting a PhD in Statistics and Modelling Science.

His return was not just a reunion with his beloved Americans it was a reunion for Americans with their own astonishing, singular past.<br> &nbsp;<br> Vowell&#x2019;s&nbsp;narrative look at our somewhat united states is&nbsp;humorous,&nbsp;irreverent&nbsp;and wholly original.<br><br></p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of October 2015:</strong> The Marquis de Lafayette, a.k.a. one of George Washington&#x2019;s best buds, is the subject of Sarah Vowell&#x2019;s latest offering, <em>Lafayette in the Somewhat United States</em>. So, why would a young French aristocrat venture to our shores to join Washington&#x2019;s army and fight in the Revolutionary War? He came for the glory! He came because he believed in American ideals! He came to escape his in-laws! But, mainly it was for the Enlightenment ideas that were unevenly embraced by many of his fellow comrades&#x2014;ideas that impacted how the war played out. I have seen eyes glaze over when I talk about this sort of thing, but anyone familiar with Vowell&#x2019;s oeuvre knows what a knack she has for making the (seemingly) mundane fascinating. She also draws some oddly comforting parallels between that time and our own (turns out that politicians have been butting heads, acting like idiots, and sporting terrible comb-overs since the birth of our great nation). There is rarely a description of Vowell that doesn&#x2019;t include the term &#x201c;acerbic,&#x201d; and her signature snark, strategically employed, is one of the things that makes &#x2018;Lafayette&#x2019; a fun (and yes, educational) read.

At the time, few grasped the significance of the event, nor understood the power that its leader would come to wield. From humble beginnings, the Congress led by Gandhi would go on to spearhead India s fight for independence from British rule: in 1947 it succeeded the British Raj as the regional ruling power.

In so doing, he goes to the heart of what sets modern India apart from most other countries in the region its vigorous democracy.</p><p><p>&nbsp;India's struggle for independence is an extraordinary story.&nbsp;The pivotal question posed by this book is how a valued and seemingly permanent imperial possession - the "jewel in the crown" - came to be given its freedom only sixty years after the establishment of the Congress National Congress in 1885. &nbsp;On the face of it, decolonisation seems to have been the direct result of nationalist pressure, but Ian Copland suggests that the reality was more complex - he gives the full social, political and economic context up to the transfer of power in 1947.

He is the author of The Wooden World and The Admiralty as well as the highly acclaimed first volume of his naval history of Britain, The Safeguard of the Sea (re-issued this month by Penguin).Starred Review. The adjective "magisterial" is justified for this colossal second volume of a complete history of British sea power, which began with <i>The Safeguard of the Sea </i>(1998); the author of the classic 18th-century British naval history, <i>The Wooden World</i>, has surpassed himself here. The book opens with the establishment of the Commonwealth in 1649; for its duration there were two British navies, the Commonwealth Navy (which laid the foundations for a professional officer corps and fought the First Dutch War of 1652&#x2013;1654) and a semipiratical Royalist Navy-in-Exile. After the Restoration, we quickly find the diarist Samuel Pepys exercising less literary but more permanent influence as secretary (or chief administrative officer) of the admiralty. The book offers colossal amounts of information (organized sometimes thematically, sometimes chronologically) right through to its endpoint of 1815, accompanied by a formidable set of notes and bibliography, as well as 24 pages of illustrations. The author not only avoids a hagiography of famous admirals but displays psychological insight in his portraits of, for example, the trio of Lord St. Vincent, his prot�g� Nelson and Nelson's indispensable second, Collingwood. Rodger also demonstrates a firm grasp of the relationship of technical subjects (the amount of tar caulking a ship needed) to British strategy (keeping the Baltic sources of tar accessible). Readers without an intense interest in the subject may be daunted; readers without some background knowledge in British social history may be somewhat at sea in the author's discussion of the officer corps and the recruitment of sailors (usually through the press-gang). Serious students of naval history, however, will find this absolutely indispensable; this is <i>the</i> place to find out whence the navy of Jack Aubrey and Horatio Hornblower came. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This is Manhattan's first atlas of historical maps, gathered from private collections and libraries throughout the world. From Giovanni da Verrazzano's first glimpse of New York Harbor in the sixteenth century to a modern aerial survey of the island, these rare and beautiful maps recount the city's urban and social history.<br>Each map is accompanied by a fascinating essay that explores its portrait of New York's changing physical and social contours. Examples from the Dutch colonial period reflect the findings of Manhattan's earliest European settlers. New York was the command center for British forces during the Revolution, and wartime maps painstakingly delineate the battleground's streams, swamps, hills, and shoreline. Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux's original plan for Central Park appears here, along with charts that reveal the development of the Manhattan grid as well as the expansion of ethnic neighborhoods, midtown vice, and the subway system. Each entry cites the map's title, date of creation and publication, cartographer, medium, and the institution or private collection where the map is archived. There is a Foreword by Tony Hiss, a bibliography, and complete index, as well as a new Introduction by Marguerite Holloway, author of <i>The Measure of Manhattan </i>(2013), and an essay by landscape ecologist Eric W. Sanderson, which includes a map by Mr. Sanderson and cartographer Markley Boyer providing a view of Manhattan Island as Henry Hudson might have seen it in 1609. <br>"Here then is the story of Manhattan as it was, as it is, and even as it might have been.

G. Jung, then president of the International Psychoanalytic Association, set out his critique and reformulation of the theory of psychoanalysis in a series of lectures in New York, ideas that were to prove unacceptable to Freud, thus creating a schism in the Freudian school. Jung challenged Freud's understandings of sexuality, the origins of neuroses, dream interpretation, and the unconscious, and Jung also became the first to argue that every analyst should themselves be analyzed. Seen in the light of the subsequent reception and development of psychoanalysis, Jung's critiques appear to be strikingly prescient, while also laying the basis for his own school of analytical psychology.</p><br><p> This volume of Jung's lectures includes an introduction by Sonu Shamdasani, Philemon Professor of Jung History at University College London, and editor of <i>Jung's Red Book</i>.</p></p><p><b>Sonu Shamdasani</b> is editor of <i>The Red Book</i> and Philemon Professor of Jung History at University College London.</p><h2>Old Testament Hebrew Vocabulary Cards: Second Edition</h2><p><p><em>Old Testament Hebrew Vocabulary Cards, Second Edition</em> by Gary D.

Mainstream explanations argue that people simply eat too much &#x201c;energy-dense&#x201d; food while exercising too little. By swapping the chips and sodas for fruits and vegetables and exercising more, the problem would be solved. By contrast, <em>The Neoliberal Diet</em> argues that increased obesity does not result merely from individual food and lifestyle choices. Since the 1980s, the neoliberal turn in policy and practice has promoted trade liberalization and retrenchment of the welfare regime, along with continued agricultural subsidies in rich countries. Neoliberal regulation has enabled agribusiness multinationals to thrive by selling highly processed foods loaded with refined flour and sugars&#x2014;a diet that originated in the United States&#x2014;as well as meat. Drawing on extensive empirical data, Gerardo Otero identifies the socioeconomic and political forces that created this diet, which has been exported around the globe, often at the expense of people&#x2019;s health.</p><p>Otero shows how state-level actions, particularly subsidies for big farms and agribusiness, have ensured the dominance of processed foods and made healthful fresh foods inaccessible to many. Comparing agrifood performance across several nations, including the NAFTA region, and correlating food access to class inequality, he convincingly demonstrates the structural character of food production and the effect of inequality on individual food choices. Resolving the global obesity crisis, Otero concludes, lies not in blaming individuals but in creating state-level programs to reduce inequality and make healthier food accessible to all.</p></p><p>Geradro Otero is a professor of international studies and sociology at Simon Fraser University. He is the author or editor of seven previous books, including Food for the Few: Neoliberal Globalism and Biotechnology in Latin America."An important and well-documented work. Rejecting the notions that diet is a matter of choice and that with education, the poor would become slimmer and healthier, Otero analyzes structures that limit healthy choices for the poor, particularly in countries linked to developed countries, as Mexico is through NAFTA. He documents how this form of food insecurity is increasing with the implementation of patented genetic engineering. Without the policies that make the technology quite useful for financialization and capital accumulation, combined with laws and tax policies that favor increased concentration in agricultural-input industries and retail distributors, the food system would look very different&#x2014;as would international migration streams and environmental quality."

But what exactly is the kingdom of God? What does it mean for the people of God and what does it mean for how they live in the world?</p><p>In <em>The Kingdom of God</em>, part of the Biblical Theology for Life series, Nicholas Perrin explores this dominant biblical metaphor, one that is paradoxically the meta-center and the mystery in Jesus' proclamation. After survey interpretations by figures from Ritschl to N. T. Wright, Perrin examines the "what, who, and how" questions of the kingdom. In his sweepingly comprehensive study, Perrin contends that the kingdom is inaugurated in Jesus' earthly ministry, but its final development awaits later events in history. In between the times, however, the people of God are called to participate in the reign of God by living out the distinctly kingdom-ethic through hope, forgiveness, love, and prayer.</p></p><p><p><strong>Nicholas Perrin</strong> <strong>PhD,</strong> Marquette University, is Franklin S.

Are you searching for greater fulfillment, significance, and meaning? Are you simply looking for a better sense of balance in your life? If you have identified with any of these statements you are not alone. Many of us experience an absence of personal significance in our lives; we have a sense that something is &#34;horribly out of whack.&#34; But, there is hope. We can have successful, rewarding careers and still experience richly textured, fulfilled personal lives. This work examines the confusion and myth of life balance, offers a new paradigm of balance, and illuminates a path for busy professionals and managers to follow to achieve real balance and deeper meaning in their lives.

With Hiroshima and the Cold War still ringing in our ears, our perception of all things nuclear is seen through the lens of weapons development. Nuclear power is full of mind-bending theories, deep secrets, and the misdirection of public consciousness, some deliberate, some accidental. The result of this fixation on bombs and fallout is that the development of a non-polluting, renewable energy source stands frozen in time.<br><br> It has been said that if gasoline were first used to make napalm bombs, we would all be driving electric cars. Our skewed perception of nuclear power is what makes James Mahaffey's new look at the extraordinary paradox of nuclear power so compelling. From medieval alchemy to Marie curie, Albert Einstein, and the Manhattan Project, atomic science is far from the spawn of a wicked weapons program. The discovery that the atom can be split brought forth the ultimate puzzle of the modern age: Now that the energy of the universe is available to us, how do we use it? For death and destruction? Or as a fuel for our society that has minimal impact on the environment and future generations?<br><br> Outlining nuclear energy's discovery and applications throughout history, Mahaffey's brilliant and accessible book is essential to understanding the astounding phenomenon of nuclear power in an age where renewable energy and climate change have become the defining concerns of the twenty-first century.<br></p><p>James Mahaffey was a senior research scientist at the Georgia Tech Research Institute where he worked under contract for&nbsp;the Defense Nuclear Agency, the National Ground Intelligence Center,&nbsp;the Air Force Air Logistics Center, and Georgia Power Company. He is the author of Atomic Awakening&nbsp;and&nbsp;Atomic Accidents&nbsp;and&nbsp;lives in Atlanta, Georgia.For many people, the idea of nuclear power died with the 1986 Chernobyl meltdown, but for the curious and open-minded, this book offers a timely look at nuclear technology that, the author argues, could provide plenty of cheap, renewable energy, if only we can get past our oversized dread of it. Mahaffey's history lesson begins along a familiar path, from 17th-century chemist Robert Boyle to the great 20th-century physicists. Nazism and WWII sent hundreds of scientists&#x2014;and their cutting-edge work&#x2014;to the U.S. But the war also sent that research underground in the ultra-secret Manhattan Project. Researchers also dreamed of peaceful atoms to generate electricity and run submarines, planes and rockets. The specters of Hiroshima and a few horrifying nuclear accidents displaced that peaceful vision. With a wealth of anecdotes, Mahaffey, a senior research scientist at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, offers hope leavened with pragmatism that, while nuclear technology may be experimental forever, it can still be useful and safe. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With exceptional clarity, Franz�n gives careful, non-technical explanations both of what those theorems say and, more importantly, what they do not. No other book aims, as his does, to address in detail the misunderstandings and abuses of the incompleteness theorems that are so rife in popular discussions of their significance. As an antidote to the many spurious appeals to incompleteness in theological, anti-mechanist and post-modernist debates, it is a valuable addition to the literature." --- John W.

Focused primarily on selves who endure and resist oppression, she addresses the ways in which devastating conditions confronted by these selves both limit and burden their moral goodness, and affect their possibilities of flourishing. She describes two different forms of "moral trouble" prevalent under oppression. The first is that the oppressed self may be morally damaged, prevented from developing or exercising some of the virtues; the second is that the very conditions of oppression require the oppressed to develop a set of virtues that carry a moral cost to those who practice them--traits that Tessman refers to as "burdened virtues." These virtues have the unusual feature of being disjoined from their bearer's own well being.<br><br>Tessman's work focuses on issues that have been missed by many feminist moral theories, and her use of the virtue ethics framework brings feminist concerns more closely into contact with mainstream ethical theory. This book will appeal to feminist theorists in philosophy and women's studies, but also more broadly, ethicists and social theorists.<br></p><p><br><strong>Lisa Tessman</strong> is Associate Professor of Philosophy and Women's Studies, Binghamton University.<br>This book is as much a contribution to feminist moral and political thought and theories of oppositional politics as it is to virtue ethics and moral psychology. * Nancy E.

This edition includes documents that provide an insight into the construction of American national identity.</p><p>Marcus Cunliffe "has provided the first scholarly editing of Parson Weem's work. He introduces the high-spirited old scamp with more sympathy than he has received in many a year, gives a short account of Weems' own life drawn from the attenuated facts available, an evaluation of the reliability of the biography, and delivers a kindly judgment: 'Weems supplied distinct needs for the American imagination. (<i>New York Herald Tribune</i>)</p><h2>69 AD: The Year of Four Emperors</h2><p>The Year of Four Emperors, so the ancient sources assure us, was one of the most chaotic, violent and frightening periods in all Roman history: a time of assassinations and civil wars, of armies so out of control that they had no qualms about occupying the city of Rome, and of ambitious men who seized power only to lose it, one after another. <br> In <em>69 AD</em>, Gwyn Morgan offers a fresh look at this period, based on two considerations to which insufficient attention has been paid in the past. First, that we need to unravel rather than cherry-pick between the conflicting accounts of Tacitus, Plutarch and Suetonius, our three main sources of information. And second, that the role of the armies, as distinct from that of their commanders, has too often been exaggerated. The result is a remarkably accurate and insightful narrative history, filled with colorful portraits of the leading participants and new insights into the nature of the Roman military Morgan ranges from the suicide of Nero in June 68 to the triumph of Vespasian in December 69. In between, three other emperors hold power. We meet Galba, old, tightfisted and conservative, who was declared emperor in June 68 and assassinated in January 69. Otho, once Nero's boon companion, who was responsible for murdering Galba, seized power in a coup in Rome in January 69 and, to everybody's surprise, committed suicide three months later in a vain attempt to end the civil wars. Vitellius, as indolent as he was extravagant, who was put forward by two ambitious lieutenants, recognized by the senate in Rome once they heard of Otho's death in April, and cut down by Vespasian's partisans in the last days of December. And then there is Vespasian, the candidate who looked least likely to succeed, but (according to Tacitus) was still the first to be improved by becoming emperor.<br> A strikingly vivid account of ancient Rome, <em>69 AD</em> is an original and compelling account of one of the best known but perhaps least understood periods in all Roman history.</p><p><br><strong>Gwyn Morgan</strong> is Professor of Classics and History at the University of Texas at Austin<br><br>"Morgan's book is a fresh and accessible look at a period that has been discussed, with sometimes horrified fascination, since antiquity itself."--<em>Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br>"Morgan's acute analyses and wry judgments on each episode as well as the whole year are indispensable, however one might differ on details, for he is never satisfied with the obvious or even the ingenious; his analysis of Othonian strategy before Bedriacum is particularly striking."--<em>The</em> <em>International History Review</em><p></p><br>"A superb portrait of this enigmatic and intriguing year."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Few people rival Gwyn Morgan in knowledge of Tacitus' Histories. The result is a fine narrative, cogent and convincing, of this momentous year."--Herbert W. Benario, author of <em>Tacitus Germany</em><p></p><br>"This important book on the <em>Histories</em> of Tacitus surpasses earlier works on the civil wars that shook Rome and its empire in the year of 69. Like Tacitus, Morgan illuminates the universal themes that make the history of this one year significant for all time--the political and social upheavals consequent on a contested transfer of power; the nature of military and political leadership, the psychology of the military and civilian masses who are involved in, or spectators of, civil war. General readers will be enlightened and moved by Morgan's narrative, while specialists will appreciate the solid scholarship on which it is founded."--Mark Morford, Professor of Classics Emeritus, University of Virginia<p></p><br>"Gwyn Morgan has produced a long-awaited and engagingly written account of the Year of Four Emperors that is unfailingly instructive and a pleasure to read. Not surprisingly, since it is based on a careful reconsideration of all the sources, while it will provide enjoyment for many, it will also prove controversial in some quarters."--Leslie Murison, author of <em>Galba, Otho and Vitellius: Careers and Controversies</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Brief Bedford Reader</h2><p><p>Inspire your writing through reading as the <em>Brief Bedford Reader</em> takes you through a variety of writing situations, teaching you the writing skills you'll need to succeed in college and your future career.</p></p><p><p><b>X.

Hughes, author of the popular <i>No Standing Around in My Gym,</i> has created 30 never-been-done-before games, tried and tested in the gymnasiums and on the fields and courts of Villa Rica, Georgia, where he teaches elementary school. These games are designed for large groups&#x2014;anywhere from 30 to 75 students&#x2014;but can be scaled back easily for smaller class sizes. Each game provides students of all athletic abilities the opportunity to have fun, be active, and acquire movement and sport skills. Here's what you will discover about the games in <i>PE2theMax:</i></p><p>- <b>No down time.</b> The games are quick and easy to get going, and they'll keep students active for the entire class period. <br>- <b>Essentially no prep time.</b> These games are ready to use, simple to understand, and supplemented with clear illustrations, diagrams, and a game finder to help you readily find the game you want.<br>- <b>Plenty of skill-building time.</b> Students acquire not only movement and sport skills but life skills as well. The games emphasize cooperation, communication, personal responsibility, respect for others, positive competition, critical thinking, and problem solving. <br>- <b>Fun participation.</b> If PE is fun, kids will want to participate. If they participate, they will experience the joy of being active. If they experience that joy, they just might move toward remaining active throughout their lives.</p><p>The games in <i>PE2theMax</i> are student centered, not teacher centered. As such, students are motivated to challenge themselves to succeed. The games are inclusive and developmentally appropriate. They define what a quality PE program and the New PE philosophy are all about: promoting participation and lifelong fitness as well as self-esteem and initiative. Most important, from the kids' perspective, &#x201c;these games rock.&#x201d; </p></p><p>J.D. Hughes has taught elementary physical education since 1995 in Douglas County, GA. His previous experiences and superior program proved invaluable experience in setting up exemplary programs at various new schools. J.D. provides a challenging yet developmentally appropriate physical learning environment striving for motor skill development, physical fitness and cognitive awareness as recognized by SHAPE America National PE Standards. He goes beyond the call of duty by working with students and families to promote physical fitness before and after school hours through F.I.T.T. Club and Roadrunner's Club. He promotes a healthy lifestyle by serving as a model and talking to students and parents, also serving as a cooperating teacher and mentor for local colleges. He is a National Board Certified Teacher (2001), holds a Master's and Education Specialist's degree. He was recognized as the 2004-2005 and 2014-2015 Georgia Elementary Physical Education Teacher of the Year and was also awarded the 2014-2015 Southern District Elementary Physical Education Teacher of the Year. J.D. also provides staff development to local school districts, conducts conference presentations and workshops all over the nation. He is passionate, constantly striving to look for new ways to improve his teaching, to share his practice, and strengthen the teaching profession.

It deals almost exclusively with those aspects of Fourier analysis that are useful in physics and engineering. Using ideas from modern analysis, it discusses the concepts and reasoning behind the techniques without getting bogged down in the technicalities of rigorous proofs. A wide variety of applications are included, in addition to discussions of integral equations and signal analysis.</p><p>With the same mastery as in his Real analysis, the author now offers us this excellent textbook on Fourier analysis: Fourier series, orthogonal systems, Bessel functions, Fourier and Laplace transforms, which are all very powerful mathematical tools in many a scientific domain. Without being exhaustive and without falling into a profusion of boring details, it nevertheless gives a panorama of these topics that is as complete as the framework of the book allows. Thus this text, which is designed for courses at the advanced undergraduate level and beyond, will also serve as a useful reference book. ---- Mathematical Reviews</p><h2>Ties That Bind: The Story of an Afro-Cherokee Family in Slavery and Freedom (American Crossroads)</h2><p>This beautifully written book, now in its second edition, tells the haunting saga of a quintessentially American family. In the late 1790s, Shoe Boots, a famed Cherokee warrior and successful farmer, acquired an African slave named Doll. Over the next thirty years, Shoe Boots and Doll lived together as master and slave and also as lifelong partners who, with their children and grandchildren, experienced key events in American history&#x2015;including slavery, the Creek War, the founding of the Cherokee Nation and subsequent removal of Native Americans along the Trail of Tears, and the Civil War. This is the gripping story of their lives, in slavery and in freedom.<br><br> Meticulously crafted from historical and literary sources, <i>Ties That Bind</i> vividly portrays the members of the Shoeboots family. Doll emerges as an especially poignant character, whose life is mostly known through the records of things done to her&#x2015;her purchase, her marriage, the loss of her children&#x2015;but also through her moving petition to the federal government for the pension owed to her as Shoe Boots's widow. A sensitive rendition of the hard realities of black slavery within Native American nations, the book provides the fullest picture we have of the myriad complexities, ironies, and tensions among African Americans, Native Americans, and whites in the first half of the nineteenth century.<br><br> Updated with a new preface and an appendix of key primary sources, this remains an essential book for students of Native American history, African American history, and the history of race and ethnicity in the United States.</p><p>&#x201c;In this lyrical narrative about Shoeboots, Doll, and their descendants, Tiya Miles explores the constant push and tug between family connections and racial divides. Building on meticulous and inspired historical detective work, Miles shows what it might have felt like to be a slave and reassesses the convoluted ideas about race that slavery generated and left as a legacy.&#x201d;&#x2015;Nancy Shoemaker, author of <i>A Strange Likeness: Becoming Red and White in Eighteenth-Century North America</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Ties That Bind</i> is a haunting and innovative book. Tiya Miles refuses to avoid or cover over the most painful aspects of the shared stories of Indians and African Americans. Instead, Miles passionately defends the need to explore history, even when the facts provided by history are not those that contemporary people want to hear.&#x201d;&#x2015;Peggy Pascoe, author of <i>Relations of Rescue: The Search for Female Moral Authority in the American West, 1874-1939</i><br><br>"The book vividly conveys how precarious were the lives of Native and African people caught up in the whirlwind of slavery, colonialism, and discourses and practices of race."&#x2015;David Chang, <i>American Quarterly</i><b>Tiya Miles </b>is Professor of History and American Culture at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. She is the author of <i>The House on Diamond Hill: A Cherokee Plantation Story</i> and <i>The Cherokee Rose: A Novel of Gardens and Ghosts.</i> Among other notable prizes and fellowships, she was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 2011.</p><h2>Red Rackham&#39;s Treasure (Adventures of Tintin)</h2><p>Product Dimensions: 8.9 x 0.4 x 12 inches Shipping Weight: 1.1 pounds The world&#39;s most famous travelling reporter sets out in search of Red Rackham&#39;s treasure. Determined to find the treasure of the notorious pirate Red Rackham, Tintin and Captain Haddock set sail aboard the Sirius to find the shipwreck of the Unicorn. With the help of an ingenious shark-shaped submarine, Tintin follows the clues deep down on this ocean adventure. Join the most iconic character in comics as he embarks on an extraordinary adventure spanning historical and political events, and thrilling mysteries. Still selling over 100,000 copies every year in the UK and having been adapted for the silver screen by Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson in 2011. The Adventures of Tintin continue to charm more than 80 years after they first found their way into publication. Since then an estimated 230 million copies have been sold, proving that comic books have the same power to entertain children and adults in the 21st century as they did in the early 20th.</p><p>Concluding the story begun in <i>The Secret of the Unicorn</i>, <i>Red Rackham's Treasure</i> follows Tintin and friends as they search for the pirate booty procured by Captain Haddock's ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock, in the West Indies. They receive some unexpected help in the form of a hard-of-hearing inventor named Professor Calculus, who would go on to become one of the most endearing characters of the series. (Herge admitted that the character was one "whom I never suspected would take on such importance.") It's a lot of fun, with some submarine and diving adventures, humor from the Thompsons, and an unexpected (but satisfying) ending. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>Herge (Georges Remi) was born in Brussels in 1907. Over the course of 54 years he completed 23 albums of The Adventures of Tintin series, which is now considered to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, comics series of all time. With translations published in over 80 languages, more than 230 million copies sold worldwide and a Hollywood movie to its name, Tintin dominates the Comics and Graphic Novels chart even today. Sadly, Herge died in 1983, leaving his 24th album, Tintin and Alph-Art, unfinished, but his hero continues to be one of the most iconic characters in both adult and children&#39;s fiction.</p><h2>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: Revised Edition</h2><p>The greatest of American classics, featuring a new introduction, follows the waif Huck down the Mississippi with a runaway slave named Jim as he discovers the meaning of friendship and finds his own morality. Reissue.</p><p>A seminal work of American Literature that still commands deep praise and still elicits controversy, <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> is essential to the understanding of the American soul. The recent discovery of the first half of Twain's manuscript, long thought lost, made front-page news. And this unprecedented edition, which contains for the first time omitted episodes and other variations present in the first half of the handwritten manuscript, as well as facsimile reproductions of thirty manuscript pages, is indispensable to a full understanding of the novel. The changes, deletions, and additions made in the first half of the manuscript indicate that Mark Twain frequently checked his impulse to write an even darker, more confrontational book than the one he finally published.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

Wilson ranges across cognate yet extraordinarily varied topics such as nature films, theme parks, tourism, world&#39;s fairs, shopping malls, and strip-mining and nuclear plants, not merely to trace their histories but also to map out their ideologies - for it is myth and ideology that ultimately legitimize and promote the violence done to the land. It is a remarkable performance, of the greatest theoretical as well as practical-political interest.&#39; Fredric Jameson, author of Postmodernism, Or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism . `Alex Wilson&#39;s cultural history of postwar landscapes and designed environments is drenched in passion and commitment. The Culture of Nature is as beautiful book that addresses an ugly topic. It will very soon be a classic of ecological criticism.&#39; Andrew Ross, author of Strange Weather . The current environmental crisis has reached far beyond the land; it is a crisis of culture as well. It penetrates our leisure time, our thinking, our art and gardens. Landscape is today a place of deeply conflicting ideas about the natural world and our relation to it. In The Culture of Nature , Wilson traces the responses of North American and Native cultures to the land. He examines the multiplicity of environments built on the North American continent in the past 50 years as its inhabitants discover, exploit, protect, restore, and re-enchant a natural world in convulsion.</p><p>The late Alexander Wilson was a horticulturalist, journalist, and partner in a landscape design firm. He taught and wrote widely on popular culture, media, and the environment.This year's round-up of environment-related titles contains some of the best books I've encountered in years.

The author presents Luther as a man of his time: a highly educated scholar and teacher and a gifted yet flawed human being driven by an optimistic yet ultimately unrealized vision of &#x201c;true religion.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> This bold, insightful account of the life of Martin Luther provides a new perspective on one of the most important religious figures in history, focusing on Luther&#x2019;s entire life, his personal relationships and political motivations, rather than on his theology alone. Relying on the latest research and quoting extensively from Luther&#x2019;s correspondence, Hendrix paints a richly detailed portrait of an extraordinary man who, while devout and courageous, had a dark side as well. No recent biography in English explores as fully the life and work of Martin Luther long before and far beyond the controversial posting of his 95 Theses in 1517, an event that will soon be celebrated as the 500th anniversary of the Reformation.</p><p>A new, definitive biography of Martin Luther provides a fresh, bold, and insightful perspective on the man most responsible for the Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century, focusing on Luther&#x2019;s entire life, his personal relationships and political motivations, rather than on his theology alone.<b>Scott H.

Exploring the subjective dynamics of a supposedly antisubjective art, and the political implications of a putatively apolitical art, <i>The First Pop Age</i> offers a fresh account of 'distressed' masculinity in Cold War culture."<b>--Mignon Nixon, Courtauld Institute of Art</b></p><p>"This is a deeply insightful, elegantly written, original, and important book that pushes beyond accepted pieties about Pop art and provides a refreshing new take on it. Seen through Hal Foster's lens, the paintings and writings of Hamilton, Lichtenstein, Warhol, Richter, and Ruscha constitute remarkably astute engagements with pop culture at the very moment of its full emergence."<b>--Michael Leja, University of Pennsylvania</b></p><p>"With visual and analytical acuity, Hal Foster offers a view of Pop art that is both genuinely new and generously open to further development. Engagingly written, with a keen sense of the shifting stakes of Pop across different contexts and careers, Foster's book is sure to become a standard reference for specialists and general readers alike."<b>--Graham Bader, Rice University</b></p><p>"In <i>The First Pop Age: Painting and Subjectivity in the Art of Hamilton, Lichtenstein, Warhol, Richter, and Ruscha</i>, Hal Foster tries to bring thinking back to Pop Art by arguing that it began with thinking--specifically, the same kind of thinking that could save art today. . . . Foster truly excels when he takes on Warhol, who sits at the center of all things Pop like a bewigged Satan at the frosty center of Dante's Hell, with all things Pop eventually feeding down to him. . . . Hal Foster's <i>The First Pop Age</i> makes the Pop Artists of years gone by seem not only much more serious than ever, but also much more seriously relevant to our image-confused modern consciousness than ever."<b>--Bob Duggan</b></p><b>Hal Foster</b> is the Townsend Martin Class of 1917 Professor of Art &amp; Archaeology at Princeton University, and the author of many books, including <i>The Return of the Real</i>, <i>Design and Crime</i>, <i>Prosthetic Gods</i>, and <i>The Art-Architecture Complex</i>.

In its two and a half centuries of service, there was hardly an epidemic or social catastrophe&#x2014;or groundbreaking scientific advance&#x2014;that did not touch Bellevue.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David Oshinsky, whose last book, <i>Polio: An American Story</i>, was awarded a Pulitzer Prize, chronicles the history of America's oldest hospital and in so doing also charts the rise of New York to the nation's preeminent city, the path of American medicine from butchery and quackery to a professional and scientific endeavor, and the growth of a civic institution. From its origins in 1738 as an almshouse and pesthouse, Bellevue today is a revered public hospital bringing first-class care to anyone in need. With its diverse, ailing, and unprotesting patient population, the hospital was a natural laboratory for the nation's first clinical research. It treated tens of thousands of Civil War soldiers, launched the first civilian ambulance corps and the first nursing school for women, pioneered medical photography and psychiatric treatment, and spurred New York City to establish the country's first official Board of Health. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As medical technology advanced, "voluntary" hospitals began to seek out patients willing to pay for their care. For charity cases, it was left to Bellevue to fill the void. The latter decades of the twentieth century brought rampant crime, drug addiction, and homelessness to the nation's struggling cities&#x2014;problems that called a public hospital's very survival into question. It took the AIDS crisis to cement Bellevue's enduring place as New York's ultimate safety net, the iconic hospital of last resort. Lively, page-turning, fascinating, <i>Bellevue</i> is essential American history.</p><p>DAVID OSHINSKY, Ph.D., is a professor in the NYU Department of History and director of the Division of Medical Humanities at the NYU School of Medicine.

A cherished landmark for New Yorkers, its iconic arch, imposing fountain, and flowered walkways provide no hint of its tumultuous past. At various times Washington Square has served as a military parade ground, a gallows, a haven for ex-�slaves, and a magnet for artists, hustlers, street performers, and protesters of every stripe. After the American Revolution, it became a mass grave for the victims of epidemic disease. <br><br>All large cities have a &#x201c;Potter&#x2019;s Field&#x201d;&#x2014;�a cemetery for unclaimed corpses. The term comes from the New Testament: &#x201c;And they took counsel and bought . . . the Potter&#x2019;s Field, to bury strangers in.&#x201d; New York established its Potter&#x2019;s Field in 1795 in response to a devastating yellow fever outbreak. Covering 9.5 acres, it created a furor because it abutted the country homes of New York&#x2019;s financial elite. &#x201c;The field lies in the neighborhood of a number of Citizens who have at great expense erected dwellings . . . for the health and accommodation of their families during the summer season,&#x201d; read a letter of protest signed by Alexander Hamilton, among others. But Mayor Richard Varick stood firm, ruling that a medical catastrophe trumped the interests of a few dozen landowners, who included some of his closest friends.<br><br>It&#x2019;s estimated that twenty thousand people were buried in Washington Square between 1795 and 1826, when the Potter&#x2019;s Field was moved farther north to Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, where Bryant Park stands today, and then to Hart Island, in the outer reaches of the Bronx. Most of the victims were recent immigrants who lived in squalid boardinghouses near the downtown wharves. Each summer and fall&#x2014;�yellow fever season&#x2014;�their bodies would be dumped into wagons and carted uptown. &#x201c;The wheels of these chariots of death rolled heavily,&#x201d; a witness recalled, &#x201c;the springs and timbers screeching and groaning as if chanting the requiem of friends departed.&#x201d;<br><br>Over the years, workers digging in Washington Square have routinely come upon human remains. But in 2009, a construction crew encountered something odd: a three-�foot grave marker with the inscription still intact. &#x201c;Here lies the body of James Jackson,&#x201d; it read, &#x201c;who [left] this life the 22nd day of September 1799, aged 28 years, native of the county of Kildare, Ireland.&#x201d; The discovery raised a pointed question: Why would someone with the means for a headstone wind up in Potter&#x2019;s Field?<br><br>City records told the story. James Jackson had achieved some modest success in New York City as a grocer, leaving behind a wife, several children, and a personal estate valued at $262. He had also applied &#x201c;to be a citizen of the United States.&#x201d; In normal times, a man of Jackson&#x2019;s standing would have been interred in a church cemetery. But New York was a city under siege in the 1790s, overwhelmed by yellow fever. In a desperate attempt to contain the disease, the dead bodies, believed by many to be contagious, were buried together in a single place. As a contemporary newspaper explained: &#x201c;It is important to remark that no persons dead of fever are admitted to any other cemetery, which has not been the case heretofore.&#x201d; And that is how the body of James Jackson, the Irish grocer, came to rest in Washington Square.<br><br>But Jackson was fortunate in one respect: he almost certainly died at home. Dozens of others were brought to a place specially created for yellow fever victims who had nowhere else to go. Little more than a pesthouse&#x2014;�a way station, truth be told, on the path to eternity&#x2014;�it would earn a grisly reputation as New York City&#x2019;s dumping ground for the terminally ill and unwanted, taking its name from the deceivingly placid acreage on which it stood: &#x201c;Bel-�Vue.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;<br><br>A number of cities claim the honor of establishing the first hospital in North America. The problem is one of definition. Many of the almshouses in colonial America contained a small infirmary to care for the destitute. In 1752, however, Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia opened its doors to medical patients alone. Founded by Dr. Thomas Bond, with a charter from the Pennsylvania legislature and the financial support of Benjamin Franklin, it was intended for &#x201c;the reception and cure of the sick poor,&#x201d; not for those seeking food or shelter or a place to die. In this sense, Pennsylvania Hospital holds a very strong hand.<br><br>Some, however, consider Belle�vue to be first. Citing records from the West India Company, when the Dutch ruled Manhattan Island, they trace Belle�vue&#x2019;s existence to a small infirmary built in the 1660s for soldiers overcome by &#x201c;bad smells and filth.&#x201d; Under British control, a permanent almshouse was constructed in 1736&#x2014;�a two-�story wood-�and-�brick structure costing �80 for building materials and fifty gallons of rum for those who &#x201c;laid the beams and raised the roof.&#x201d; It contained a workspace for the able-�bodied, a room for the sick and the insane, and a prison in the cellar for the &#x201c;unruly and obstinate,&#x201d; complete with a whipping post. Those found &#x201c;to be Lousey or to have the Itch&#x201d; were segregated &#x201c;til perfectly Clean.&#x201d; This one-�room infirmary, we are told, is &#x201c;the seed from which grew the mighty oak of Belle�vue.&#x201d;<br><br>Built on the site of today&#x2019;s City Hall Park, the almshouse became a vital public institution. Serving just nineteen paupers in 1736, it housed close to eight hundred of them by 1795, as New York&#x2019;s population soared. To stem the tide, city officials took to rounding up vagrants and prostitutes and paying their transportation out of town&#x2014;�but it barely made a dent. The almshouse commissioners demanded ever-�larger budgets, blaming their costs on &#x201c;the prodigious influx of indigent foreigners,&#x201d; mainly from Ireland. In the 1790s the city opened a larger almshouse financed by a municipal lottery, a common money-�raising device. But its infirmary was soon overwhelmed by yellow fever, which brought dozens of sick and dying victims to its door. As panic spread, the Common Council leased a vacant property along the East River, far from the city center, to house the &#x201c;wretched overflow.&#x201d;<br><br>The land they chose had a checkered past. Once prized for its lush gardens and freshwater breezes, it had first belonged to a prominent Dutch settler named Jacobus Kip, who built a house there in 1641&#x2014;�the Kip&#x2019;s Bay Estate&#x2014;�using bricks imported from Holland. In the 1700s, Kip&#x2019;s heirs had divided the land, selling one parcel to a local merchant who named it Bel-�Vue for its rolling fields and river vistas. A grander home was soon constructed&#x2014;�one so impressive that it played host to both the fleeing General George Washington and his British pursuer, General William Howe, during the darkest moments of the Revolutionary War. Shortly thereafter, it passed into the hands of Lindley Murray, an eccentric scholar whose popular books about the English language had made him a spectacularly rich man. Murray wrote lovingly of a mansion &#x201c;delightfully situated&#x201d; on rolling farmland overlooking &#x201c;a grand expanse of water.&#x201d; In truth, he barely set foot there before sailing off to London&#x2014;�the proper place, he believed, for &#x201c;the father of English grammar.&#x201d;<br><br>An advertisement soon appeared:<br><br>For SALE or to be LET. That beautiful COUNTRY SEAT called Bel-�Vue, situated on the banks of the East River, about 3 miles from the city, and as its properties in point of health and other advantages are well known, it is unnecessary to describe them.<br><br>The price being steep, it didn&#x2019;t sell quickly. Five years passed before Henry Brockholst Livingston, a prominent New York attorney and future U.S. Supreme Court justice, paid �2,000 for the six-�acre estate.<br><br>Livingston, it turned out, had no intention of living there, either. The property&#x2014;�referred to interchangeably as &#x201c;Bel-�Vue,&#x201d; &#x201c;Belle-�Vue,&#x201d; and, finally, &#x201c;Belle�vue&#x201d;&#x2014;�passed from one renter to the next before the Common Council leased it in 1795 &#x201c;to serve as a hospital for the accommodation and relief of such persons afflicted with contagious distempers&#x201d;&#x2014;�or yellow fever. Described by nervous officials as &#x201c;a proper distance from the inhabited part of this city,&#x201d; it was accessible by road and river, with a dock already in place. The plans called for hiring a steward, a matron, a resident physician, and &#x201c;as many nurses as may be wanted.&#x201d; There would be &#x201c;two men to transport the sick to Belle�vue&#x201d; in wagons and &#x201c;a Boat with good oars-�men&#x201d; to ship in needed supplies. Port, brandy, and &#x201c;assorted spirits&#x201d; headed that list, with detailed instructions for the doctor. &#x201c;Sherry wine, the most natural stimulus, should be given freely,&#x201d; he was told, and &#x201c;beer, for those who are accustomed to its use, is a very valuable remedy.&#x201d;<br><br>New York City had seen its share of epidemic disease. From the Dutch settlement forward, infectious outbreaks were a common part of daily life. The first Europeans had praised New Amsterdam&#x2019;s &#x201c;sweet and wholesome climate&#x201d;&#x2014;�more forgiving than the brutal cold to the north in Boston, less treacherous than the fetid swampland to the south in Jamestown. But Manhattan&#x2019;s bustling harbor soon became a magnet for the world&#x2019;s microbes and maladies. Periodic eruptions of measles, influenza, scarlet fever, and &#x201c;throat distemper&#x201d; (diphtheria) killed untold numbers in the colonial era, especially children. Barely a decade went by in the 1700s without a serious outbreak of smallpox. New York recorded more than five hundred deaths from this disease in 1731, a staggering total in a city of barely ten thousand people. While the threat of smallpox would recede by the early 1800s&#x2014;�due mainly to the introduction of Edward Jenner&#x2019;s revolutionary vaccine&#x2014;�other diseases proved more difficult to contain. The most frightening one, by far, was yellow fever.<br><br>It seemed odd that a disease associated with the tropics would find a home this far north. Yellow fever&#x2014;�commonly known as &#x201c;Yellow Jack&#x201d; for the warning flags flown on infected ships&#x2014;�is transmitted by the bite of the female Aedes aegypti mosquito. In mild cases, the symptoms include a headache and moderate fever, similar to the flu. But the more severe ones can produce delirium, jaundice (lending skin a yellow tinge), and massive bleeding from the mouth, nose, and ears. Most early accounts of yellow fever refer to the victim&#x2019;s horrifying &#x201c;black vomit,&#x201d; the discharge of blood-�soaked material from the stomach. Case mortality in a serious epidemic can reach upward of 50 percent. The only good news is that the surviving victims are rewarded with immunity for life.<br><br>Yellow fever came to the Americas from Africa, carried by slave ships that docked in the West Indies. Water barrels on board provided an ideal breeding ground for the Aedes aegypti. Over time, as trade routes expanded, yellow fever reached North America&#x2019;s eastern ports. In the summer of 1793 it struck Philadelphia, the young nation&#x2019;s capital, with a fury that shook the national government to its core. By November, the streets were deserted and more than 10 percent of the city&#x2019;s fifty thousand residents were dead. Most of Congress was gone, along with President George Washington and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, who fled to their native Virginia. For Jefferson, a defender of rural values, the epidemic was a mixed blessing, with a powerful lesson attached. &#x201c;The yellow fever will discourage the growth of great cities in our nation,&#x201d; he confidently wrote a friend, &#x201c;&amp; I view great cities as pestilential to the morals, the health and the liberties of man.&#x201d;<br><br>Jefferson was wrong, of course, though the enormous damage done to Philadelphia did dramatically slow its growth. Yellow fever reached New York City in the summer of 1795 on a brig from Haiti with a very sick crew. A port officer who boarded the infected vessel died a few days later, the first of many to come. While hardly matching the carnage of Philadelphia, the disease proved deadlier than anything the city had seen before.<br><br>What caused yellow fever was a matter of debate. Medical opinion in this era endorsed the so-�called Miasma Theory, which blamed illnesses on chemical agents from decayed matter&#x2014;�corpses, rotting fruits and vegetables, swamp and sewer gases&#x2014;�that formed dangerous airborne clouds. Those who studied disease spent much of their time minutely analyzing atmospheric conditions: sunlight, humidity, temperature, rainfall, lightning, cloud cover, and wind direction. As late as 1888, Belle�vue&#x2019;s specialist in childhood diseases insisted that diphtheria, a deadly bacterial infection, resulted mainly from inhaling the damp gases that rose from the sewers. (He also warned against the danger of kissing a cat.)<br><br>Yellow fever split the medical community into warring factions. One saw it as a contagious disease, much like smallpox or influenza, which could spread from person to person through the victim&#x2019;s breath or clothing&#x2014;�or corpse. How this occurred was still a mystery; one physician described the process as &#x201c;effluvia arising directly from the body of a man under a particular disease, and exciting the same kinds of disease in the body of the person to whom they are applied.&#x201d; This camp viewed yellow fever as an imported illness, reaching New York harbor on West Indian ships. The solution, therefore, was to quarantine arriving vessels in order to isolate the carriers&#x2014;�an expensive process that severely restricted trade.<br><br>The competing group blamed local conditions for the disease, especially the &#x201c;noxious smells and vapors&#x201d; along the wharves. Person-�to-�person contact made little sense, these doctors argued, because they &#x201c;continually touched the sick, lived in the midst of them, and breathed the same air&#x201d; without personally contracting yellow fever. Their solution was to destroy the noxious miasma clouds by scrubbing the city clean; they saw no reason to quarantine its vital harbor.<br><br>On one point, however, both sides seemed to agree: poor New Yorkers were more susceptible to the disease. Contagious or not, yellow fever appeared most often in the flophouse waterfront districts catering to sailors, dockworkers, and recent arrivals. Valentine Seaman, a leading New York physician, drew a map of these yellow fever cases&#x2014;�a forerunner of John Snow&#x2019;s legendary cholera &#x201c;Ghost Map&#x201d;&#x2014;�to show the epidemic&#x2019;s concentrated path. Noting the large number of sickened Irish immigrants, Seaman thought this more than coincidental. Hard drinking and filth had weakened their constitutions, he believed, while their heavy &#x201c;vegetable diet&#x201d; had left them vulnerable to the rigors of American life. As further proof, New York officials claimed that only &#x201c;five or six&#x201d; native-�born merchants and a lone minister&#x2014;�a questionable sort&#x2014;�had died in the epidemic. He was, the Episcopalian Seaman lamented, a Methodist.<br><br>The fact that shipborne mosquitoes thrived along the waterfront was not then a matter of concern. The very idea that a tiny vector like the Aedes aegypti could cause such an immense catastrophe was simply beyond scientific understanding. Still, what is striking about the writings of New Yorkers in the summer of 1795 is the constant notice of mosquitoes: swarming, biting, relentless, and inescapable. Valentine Seaman remarked that he had never seen as many people &#x201c;covered with blisters from their venomous operations.&#x201d; His good friend, Dr. Elihu Hubbard Smith, recorded these words in his diary: &#x201c;Thursday, September 6&#x2014;�Passed a restless and perturbed night tormented with mosquitoes and incongruous dreams.&#x201d;</p><h2>Understanding Quantum Mechanics</h2><p><p>Here Roland Omn�s offers a clear, up-to-date guide to the conceptual framework of quantum mechanics. In an area that has provoked much philosophical debate, Omn�s has achieved high recognition for his <i>Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics</i> (Princeton 1994), a book for specialists. Now the author has transformed his own theory into a short and readable text that enables beginning students and experienced physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers to form a comprehensive picture of the field while learning about the most recent advances.</p><br><p> This new book presents a more streamlined version of the Copenhagen interpretation, showing its logical consistency and completeness. The problem of measurement is a major area of inquiry, with the author surveying its history from Planck to Heisenberg before describing the consistent-histories interpretation. He draws upon the most recent research on the decoherence effect (related to the modern resolution of the famous Schr�dinger's cat problem) and an exact formulation of the correspondence between quantum and particle physics (implying a derivation of classical determinism from quantum probabilism).</p><br><p> Interpretation is organized with the help of a universal and sound language using so-called consistent histories. As a language and a method, it can now be shown to be free of ambiguity and it makes interpretation much clearer and closer to common sense.</p></p><p><b>Roland Omn�s</b> is Professor of Physics at the University of Paris XI.

G. Wells's wildly imaginative story of London in the twenty-second century and the man who by accident becomes owner and master of the world. In 1897 a Victorian gentleman falls into a sleep from which he cannot be waked. During his two centuries of slumber he becomes the Sleeper, the most well&nbsp;known and powerful person in the world. All property is bequeathed to the Sleeper to be administered by a Council on his behalf. The common people, increasingly oppressed, view the Sleeper as a mythical liberator whose awakening will free them from misery. <p>The Sleeper awakes in 2100 to a futuristic London adorned with wondrous technological trappings yet staggering under social injustice and escalating unrest. His awakening sends shock waves throughout London, from the highest meetings of the Council to the workers laboring in factories in the bowels of the city. Daring rescues and villainous treachery abound as workers and capitalists fight desperately for control of the Sleeper.</p></p><p>H. G. Wells (1866&#x2013;1946) is one of the most influential figures in the history of science fiction. This commemorative edition of <i>The Sleeper Awakes</i> features Wells's preferred revision of the novel&#x2014;published in 1910 and never before widely available in the United States&#x2014;and his prefaces to the 1910 and 1921 editions.

Trainer Wini Linguvic showed him how to get that look. And in <i>BodyChange</i>, she'll show you, too. Linguvic's exercise routine incorporates aerobics with weight training, particularly functional exercises (using the muscles the way we use them in real life) and core exercises (emphasizing the abdominal and lower-back muscles for stabilization, strength, and balance) using free weights and a Swiss ball. "You're stronger than you think," Linguvic says, "but to experience that strength, you've got to stretch beyond that feeling of comfort."<p> The program is sound, clearly explained, and well illustrated. Photos by Mitchel Gray are awesome, especially the artistic poses of Williams and Linguvic together. The strength-training routine that comprises most of the book is a basic program that beginners can handle: three sets each of nine fundamental exercises that target all the major muscle groups for beginners; a few more for intermediate and advanced exercisers. Despite a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and a work and travel schedule that would reduce most of us to mush, Williams continues to work out daily and look great--a positive testament to Linguvic's routine. <i>--Joan Price</i></p></p><h2>Programming in Mathematica</h2><p>This work describes Mathematica programming methods and then explains how to apply them to the construction of the actual programs. In addition, it also discusses the software engineering issues of writing and using larger programs in Mathematica.</p><p>Mathematica was officially announced in June of 1988. Since then it has found many uses in very diverse fields. While it is useful to do a few calculations interactively, its real strength lies in the programming language it offers. Writing programs, one extends Mathematica with specialized new functions in one's own field of interest.<p>Mathematica's programming language is unlike any you have encountered before. The language's manual explains all its features and gives some very basic examples of their use. For writing good programs, however, this is not enough: there is clearly a need for a book explaining all the many features in context and giving more extensive examples of their use. The first edition of this book filled this gap for version 1.2 of Mathematica. Like the second edition, this third edition was prompted by a major new version of Mathematica, Version 3.0.</p><p> I have been in contact with many early users of Mathematica and I have also given students at the University of Illinois and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology an opportunity to learn about it. I have seen many programs written in Mathematica, good ones and bad ones. The bad ones invariably solve a particular problem in an unnecessarily complicated way, perhaps because the programmers were unaware of the elegant constructs available in Mathematica. Let me point out these constructs and show you how they can be used to write concise, elegant, and efficient programs.</p><p> The best way to teach these Mathematica-specific programming methods is to look at examples of complete programs that solve some nontrivial problem. Even if the example chosen does not lie in the particular field of application that you are interested in, you will be able to use similar ideas for your own programs. Many of the examples presented here deal with graphics. Graphics applications are especially suited for learning programming, because it is easy to see whether your code is correct simply by looking at the picture it produces. Advanced graphics applications are also sufficiently challenging to require advanced programming methods. Other examples come from symbolic computation, geometry, dynamics, and numerical mathematics. Along the way, we also develop many short pieces of code that can be used as parts of larger programs or that help to customize Mathematica to your particular needs. Many of these found their way into the standard Mathematica distribution and are now available to all users. </p><p>Because there exists an excellent manual, this book does not explain everything from scratch, but assumes some familiarity with Mathematica. I assume also that you have access to a computer on which to try out the examples. In this book I want to tell you how you can use Mathematica for more than just typing in single commands. If you are using Mathematica for your work, teaching, or solving homework assignments, sooner or later you will encounter more advanced problems requiring many commands to solve, or you will be faced with doing the same calculation steps over and over again with different input. This is the point at which you want to start writing programs. Mathematica includes a rich and powerful programming language. Unlike the usual languages such as BASIC and C, it is not restricted to a small number of data types, but allows you to perform all its symbolic computations. The Mathematica manual can only hint at the possibilities. It explains all the features but does not show you which ones to use for a particular problem or how to fit things together into larger programs. </p><p>Through design and tradition, each programming language has developed a certain preferred style of good programming. It is possible to solve the same problem in many different ways, but there is usually some idea about what is a good or a bad program. In this book, I want to present examples of what the designers of</p><p>Mathematica think is good programming style and show you why this is so. Even if you write your programs strictly for personal use, you will benefit from following a good style. For developing programs for others to use, adhering to this style is indispensable.</p><p>The programming examples in this book serve two purposes. First, they help explain concepts and show how things fit together to make up complete programs. Second, they are designed to be more than mere toy programs and should prove useful in their own right. In developing an example we always use the same method. We start out with a few commands or definitions that could be entered directly into Mathematica. We then extract the parts of the computation that are the same regardless of the input and define some functions or procedures that automate these steps. Then we apply standard techniques to these functions to make them into a package, adding documentation and certain programming constructs that make such a package easier to use. The goal is to write a program that would be useful not only to its author, who knows how it works, but also to other people. Finally, we might add a few more functions to the package or look at alternatives to what we did so far. In Chapter 1 these steps are described in full detail. Later on, when we concentrate on other aspects, we assume that you are familiar with these basic concepts and we shall not mention all the steps in detail. All the programs developed in this book are either part of the standard Mathematica distribution from Wolfram Research, or they are available free in electronic form. </p><p>Version 3.0 brings major new features. The programming language itself has not changed all that much, but many problems that required elaborate workarounds and many inconsistencies have been remedied. As a consequence, it is now possible to present the material on packages in a more logical fashion. The support for developing larger applications has been improved, and this edition discusses the software engineering issues of writing and using larger programs in Mathematica. The treatment of exact numeric quantities is another area of improvement, and the way numerical code should be written has changed. All programs have been revised to take advantage of the many new built-in functions. I added more material about functional and structural programming. These techniques are fundamental to writing good Mathematica code, but they are not available in most other programming languages and therefore need an expanded treatment. </p><p>The most important addition to Version 3.0 is, of course, the new frontend and the typesetting capabilities. The fact that notebooks and typeset formulae are represented as ordinary Mathematica expressions means that they can be manipulated easily with programs. This capability leads to some fascinating applications, and the new material on the frontend and typesetting teaches you how to develop such applications.</p><p>A complete, larger application (iterated function systems), more exercises, and an updated bibliography complete this expanded and revised edition. </p><p> This book is no replacement for the Mathematica manual The Mathematica Book. I do not expect that you have read everything in the manual, but you should have some basic experience with Mathematica before reading this book. Single commands are usually used without detailed explanation. You can use the index in The Mathematica Book to look up a description of a command that you did not know about. We also give references to places in The Mathematica Book where you can find explanations of concepts that are particularly relevant to a topic in this book. You should always turn to The Mathematica Book for explanations of features that are assumed known here, but that you have not used yet. The place to look for an explanation of all variants, defaults, or options for a particular command is the Reference Guide in the back of the book. All this information is also available in electronic form and can be accessed through the Help Browser of Mathematica. </p><p>All explanations about how Mathematica works are based on Version 3.0. The first edition of this book was about Version 1.2. Many things have changed in the new version. I added a few sections called "Changes from Earlier Editions"for the benefit of readers familiar with earlier versions of Mathematica or the first and second edition of this book. </p><p>I am grateful to many people who have contributed to this book. My thanks go first to the other developers of Mathematica. The language was shaped through countless discussions and many heated arguments. Trying to explain to each other why we think a certain feature should be done in a certain way has deepened our understanding of the matters involved and has given the language its overall consistency, despite the fact that it contains hundreds of commands and unifies many diverse programming paradigms. </p><p>Helpful ideas for this book came from Jim Feagin, Theodore Gray, Dan Grayson, Jerry Keiper, Silvio Levy, Troels Petersen, Will Self, Bruce Smith, Ilan Vardi, Ferrell Wheeler, and Stephen Wolfram. Some of the examples I used were inspired by Henry Cejtin, John Gray, Lee Rubel, William Thurston, Ilan Vardi, Jnrg Waldvogel, and Dave With</p><p>This revised and expanded edition of the standard reference on programming in Mathematica addresses all the new features in the latest Version 3 of the software. The support for developing larger applications has been improved, and the book now discusses the software engineering issues related to writing and using larger programs in Mathematica. As before, Roman Maeder, one of the original authors of the Mathematica system, explains how to take advantage of its powerful built-in programming language.</p><p>New topics in this edition include:</p><p> </p><ul> <li>The programmable front-end;</li><li>The language for typesetting mathematical expressions and the treatment of exact numerical quantities;</li><li>A completely developed larger application, iterated function systems. This code allows readers to explore the fascinating world of chaos and fractals with Mathematica.<p> </p></li></ul>Current users of Mathematica, Version 2, and new users of Version 3 will benefit alike from this up-to-date reference to Mathematica programming.<p></p> <br> <br> 020185449XB04062001</p><h2>Women Heroes of the American Revolution: 20 Stories of Espionage, Sabotage, Defiance, and Rescue (Women of Action)</h2><p><p>Every schoolchild knows about Paul Revere&#x2019;s 20-mile ride to warn that the British were coming.

Originally published in Romanian in 1933, this semiautobiographical novel by the world renowned scholar Mircea Eliade details the passionate awakenings of Alain, an ambitious young French engineer flush with colonial pride and prejudice and full of a European fascination with the mysterious subcontinent.<br> <br> Offered the hospitality of a senior Indian colleague, Alain grasps at the chance to discover the authentic India firsthand. He soon finds himself enchanted by his host's daughter, the lovely and inscrutable Maitreyi, a precocious young poet and former student of Tagore. What follows is a charming, tentative flirtation that soon, against all the proprieties and precepts of Indian society, blossoms into a love affair both impossible and ultimately tragic. This erotic passion plays itself out in Alain's thoughts long after its bitter conclusion. In hindsight he sets down the story, quoting from the diaries of his disordered days, and trying to make sense of the sad affair.<br> <br> A vibrantly poetic love story, <i>Bengal Nights</i> is also a cruel account of the wreckage left in the wake of a young man's self discovery. At once horrifying and deeply moving, Eliade's story repeats the patterns of European engagement with India even as it exposes and condemns them. Invaluable for the insight it offers into Eliade's life and thought, it is a work of great intellectual and emotional power.<br> <br> Translated into French in 1950, <i>Bengal Nights</i> was an immediate critical success. The film, <i>Les Nuits Bengali</i>, appeared in 1987.</p></p><p>Set in 1930s Calcutta, this semiautobiographical novel by the world-renowned scholar Mircea Eliade details the passionate love affair of Alain, a young French engineer, and Maitreyi, the daughter of his Indian employer.

Together with his friend William Wordsworth, he provided the best articulation of Romanticism, as well as some of the most powerful examples of that aesthetic. This collection, from the excellent Everyman&#39;s Library Pocket Poets series, includes not only Coleridge&#39;s poetry, but also some selections from his insightful essays and letters about poetry. But of course, it&#39;s the poems that count the most, as evidenced by this excerpt from one of Coleridge&#39;s less legendary works, his beautiful tribute &#34;To William Wordsworth,&#34; which was written after hearing his friend give an especially moving reading. These sentiments could easily apply to the author himself: &#34;The tumult rose and ceased: for Peace is nigh / Where Wisdom&#39;s voice has found a listening heart.&#34;Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price.

Not a disorder but a neurological trait&#x2015;like perfect pitch&#x2015;synesthesia creates vividly felt cross-sensory couplings. A synesthete might hear a voice and at the same time see it as a color or shape, taste its distinctive flavor, or feel it as a physical touch. In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, Richard Cytowic, the expert who returned synesthesia to mainstream science after decades of oblivion, offers a concise, accessible primer on this fascinating human experience.</p><p>Cytowic explains that synesthesia's most frequent manifestation is seeing days of the week as colored, followed by sensing letters, numerals, and punctuation marks in different hues even when printed in black. Other manifestations include tasting food in shapes, seeing music in moving colors, and mapping numbers and other sequences spatially. One synesthete declares, &#x201c;Chocolate smells pink and sparkly&#x201d;; another invents a dish (chicken, vanilla ice cream, and orange juice concentrate) that tastes intensely blue. Cytowic, who in the 1980s revived scientific interest in synesthesia, sees it now understood as a spectrum, an umbrella term that covers five clusters of outwardly felt couplings that can occur via several pathways. Yet synesthetic or not, each brain uniquely filters what it perceives. Cytowic reminds us that each individual's perspective on the world is thoroughly subjective.</p></p><p>Richard E.

It focuses on Egypt's evolution as a nation-state, dispelling common misconceptions about Egypt's modern history. Professor Goldschmidt calls upon recent Egyptian and Western scholarship to document pivotal points, such as the 1952 revolution, and to illuminate controversies, such as those surrounding Sadat's role in the 1973 war with Israel. <em>Modern Egypt</em> is anecdotal as well as authoritative, covering social history, religion, politics, economics, military history, geography, and even the psychology of selected leaders.

Today, George Lakoff&#x2019;s classic text has become all the more relevant, as liberals and conservatives have come to hold even more vigorously opposed views of the world, with the underlying assumptions of their respective worldviews at the level of basic morality. Even more so than when Lakoff wrote, liberals and conservatives simply have very different, deeply held beliefs about what is right and wrong.<br> <br> Lakoff reveals radically different but remarkably consistent conceptions of morality on both the left and right. Moral worldviews, like most deep ways of understanding the world, are unconscious&#x2014;part of our &#x201c;hard-wired&#x201d; brain circuitry. When confronted with facts that don&#x2019;t fit our moral worldview, our brains work automatically and unconsciously to ignore or reject these facts, and it takes extraordinary openness and awareness of this phenomenon to pay critical attention to the vast number of facts we are presented with each day. For this new edition, Lakoff has added a new preface and afterword, extending his observations to major ideological conflicts since the book's original publication, from the Affordable Care Act to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the recent financial crisis, and the effects of global warming. One might have hoped such massive changes would bring people together, but the reverse has actually happened; the divide between liberals and conservatives has become stronger and more virulent.<br> <br> To have any hope of bringing mutual respect to the current social and political divide, we need to clearly understand the problem and make it part of our contemporary public discourse. <i>Moral Politics</i> offers a much-needed wake-up call to both the left and the right.<br> </p></p><p><b>George Lakoff</b> is distinguished professor of cognitive science and linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley.

And why do we call it a cat? How much of our perception of things is based on cognitive ability, and how much on linguistic resources? Here, in six remarkable essays, Umberto Eco explores in depth questions of reality, perception, and experience. Basing his ideas on common sense, Eco shares a vast wealth of literary and historical knowledge, touching on issues that affect us every day. At once philosophical and amusing, Kant and the Platypus is a tour of the world of our senses, told by a master of knowing what is real and what is not.<br></p><p>Describing Umberto Eco as a writer is like describing the platypus as an animal. What do readers expect when they see the author's name on a book jacket? It's a tricky question to answer, given his range and versatility: he has produced studies of semiotics, children's books, medieval history, essays on contemporary culture, and, of course, novels--most notably <i>The Name of the Rose</i> and <i>The Island of the Day Before</i>. So first, a word of warning. Anyone familiar with Eco the novelist or essayist might well be dismayed by <i>Kant and the Platypus</i>, for this new book returns to his preoccupations of the 1960s and 1970s--to semiotics and cognitive semantics. As such, it can be a daunting volume (the initial chapter, for example, riffs on the numerous philosophical concepts of being). And second, a word of encouragement: this is a wonderful engagement with the issues of language itself. Even as he beckons the reader into one linguistic thicket after another, Eco always keeps a commonsensical perspective, using stories to explicate the knottiest concepts.<p> Why did Marco Polo describe the rhinoceros as a type of unicorn? Why couldn't 18th-century observers figure out how to classify the duck-billed platypus? Given a dictionary or encyclopedia definition of a mouse, how easy would it be to identify one if we had never seen one before? These are some of the examples that Eco uses to explore the ways in which we see and describe the world--the ways, that is, in which cultures develop taxonomies. If you want to know "why we can tell an elephant from an armadillo," or why mirrors do <i>not</i> in fact reverse images, this book will tell you. In fact, it will also tell you why you know what I am talking about when I say "this book." Got it? No? Then get it. <i>--Burhan Tufail</i></p>UMBERTO ECO (1932&#x2013;2016) was the author of numerous essay collections and seven novels, including <i>The Name of the Rose,</i><i>The Prague Cemetery, </i>and <i>Inventing the Enemy. </i>He received Italy&#x2019;s highest literary award, the Premio Strega, was named a Chevalier de la L�gion d&#x2019;Honneur by the French government, and was an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.</p><h2>Introduction to Post-Tonal Theory (2nd Edition)</h2><p>A <i>primer</i>--rather than a survey--this book offers exceptionally clear, simple explanations of basic theoretical concepts for the post-tonal music of the twentieth century.

In addition to her book, Avila also wrote poetry, plays, and gave lectures throughout the United States.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Joy Parker </b>is the coauthor of several books including<b> </b><i>Woman Who Glows in the Dark: A Curandera Reveals Traditional Aztec Secrets of Physical and Spiritual Health</i>, <i>Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years on the Shaman&#x2019;s Path</i>, and <i>The Sound of the Earth: A Man&#x2019;s Mid-Life Passage and Spiritual Awakening.<b> </b></i><br><br><b>Clarissa Pinkola Estes </b>is a poet, trauma specialist, and Jungian psychoanalyst most recognized as the author of <i>Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype</i>. She is also a spoken word performer and has performed with Maya Angelou and Toni Morrison.In the border towns of south Texas, the Mexican "folk" medicine called curanderismo is often regarded as witchcraftAa means for hex removals and love divinations. Avila was therefore surprised to learn in her masters program in psychiatric nursing at the University of Texas that curanderismo is a broad-based fusion of Aztec, Spanish and African traditional medicines with hundreds of useful applications. This discovery, coupled with her dissatisfaction with the limitations of conventional mental health practices, motivated Avila, who grew up in a first-generation Chicano family in El Paso, Tex., to apprentice with an Aztec master and eventually to become a full-time curandera. Her first book, co-written with Parker (coauthor of Maya Cosmos), is a clear-sighted introduction to the fundamentals of this alternative healing practice. It describes the healers, who range from spiritual counselors to general practitioners and massage therapists; their counseling techniques, ritual purifications and soul retrievals; characteristics of common diseases; and formulas for achieving a balanced lifestyle, a rich spiritual life and good nutrition. The down-to-earth explanations of such afflictions as envidia (envy), susto (fright or loss of soul) and mal puesto (bad luck) will help dispel misconceptions about these "folk" ailments that, in curandero terms, are common to all people. Particularly thought-provoking is Avila's perspective on mainstream mental health and her preference for the holistic curandero approach to treating mental diseases, including psychosis and imbalances induced by severe trauma. "A good curandera," she writes, "can help us find the middle ground in a culture where balance, reality, and enlightened compromise are not always part of our support system."

His long life and extraordinary work capacity - coupled with a sometimes furious perfectionism--he dedicated to a pictorial exploration of the sensations which reality, and in particular landscape offer the human eye. But while Monet the painter was faithful and persevering in the pursuit of his motifs, his personal life - characterized by frequent travels and changes of location -- followed a more restless course. Parisian by birth, he discovered plein-air painting as a youth in the provinces and sought to defy his family&#39;s insistence upon an academic painter&#39;s training. For over half his life the artist was plagued by financial worries, which in part precipitated the frequent moves made by his expanding household. Two of his homes stand out above the rest. The first, Argenteuil, has come to represent the artistic flowering and official establishment of Impressionism as a movement, with Monet as its creative leader. But it was also Monet who, in his endeavour to capture the ever-changing face of reality, went beyond Impressionism and thereby beyond the confines of the self-contained panel painting. This step he took in the village of Giverny: here he painted the Poplars, Grain Stacks and Rouen Cathedral series in which he addressed one motif in constantly new variations. Here, too, Monet laid out the famous garden with its water lily pond which he was to paint on huge canvases well into the 1920s. He thereby sought to render not reality as objectively experienced, but rather that which takes place &#39;between the motif and the artist&#39;. In their open, nolonger more than tenuously representational structure and impressive scale, his water lily paintings - created long before the currents of the contemporary avant-garde-point the way forward to the developments of the future.</p><p>Karin Sagner-Duchting, born in Erlabrunn-Steinheldel, studied art history, new German literature and classical archaeology at Munich University. She gained her doctorate in 1983 with a thesis on Claude Monet&#39;s water lily paintings (Hildeshelm 1985).

Not only did it produce many of the greatest films of the American cinema, but it was then that Hollywood itself became firmly established as the nation&#x2019;s ultimate symbol of glamour and style, its stars almost godlike figures whose dazzling lives were chronicled in countless features in magzazines like <i>Photoplay </i>and <i>Modern Screen</i>.<br><br>While these features were a standard part of the work of studio publicity departments, they told eager readers little about what life was really like for these celebrities once they stepped out of the public eye. No one is better qualified to tell that story than Robert Wagner, whose own career has spanned more than five decades and whose <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, <i>Pieces of My Heart</i>, was one of the most successful Hollywood memoirs in recent years. <i>You Must Remember This</i> is Wagner&#x2019;s intimate ode to a bygone time, one of magnificent homes, luxurious hotels, opulent night-clubs and restaurants, and unforgettable parties that were all part of the Hollywood social scene at its peak.<br><br>From a dinner party at Clifton Webb&#x2019;s at which Judy Garland sang Gershwin at the piano to golf games with Fred Astaire, from Jimmy Cagney&#x2019;s humble farmhouse in Coldwater Canyon to the magnificent beach mansion built by William Randolph Hearst for Marion Davies, from famous restaurants like the Brown Derby and Romanoff&#x2019;s to nightspots like the Trocadero and the Mocambo, Wagner shares his affectionate memories and anec�dotes about the places and personalities that have all become part of Hollywood legend.<br><br>As poignant as it is revealing, <i>You Must Remember This</i> is Wagner&#x2019;s account of Hollywood as he saw it, far from the lights and cameras and gossip columns&#x2014;and a tender farewell to the people of a mythical place long since transformed, and to a golden age long since passed.</p><p>Robert Wagner&nbsp;is the star of such films as <i>A Kiss Before Dying</i>, <i>The Longest Day</i>, <i>The Pink Panther</i>, and most recently, the Austin Powers franchise. On television, he starred in <i>It Takes a Thief </i>(with Fred Astaire), <i>Switch </i>(with Eddie Albert and Sharon Gless), and <i>Hart to Hart </i>(with Stefanie Powers). He has recently appeared on <i>Two and a Half Men </i>and <i>NCIS</i>. He is married to actress Jill St. John and lives in Aspen, Colorado.I first noticed that show business had gone crazy in 2002, when my wife, Jill St. John, and I were guests at the wedding of Liza Minnelli and David Gest.<p>I had known Judy Garland, Liza's mother, since the very early fif�ties, when she would sing at Clifton Webb's parties, backed up by Roger Edens on the piano. I had been her escort to the royal premiere in London of <i>I Could Go On Singing, </i>her last starring film. (And to answer the obvious question, she was in very good shape that night� thin and sober.) And Vincente Minnelli, Judy's ex-husband and Liza's father, had shot a week or so of retakes for <i>All the Fine Young Cannibals, </i>a film I had made with my wife Natalie Wood at MGM in 1960.</p><p>As for David Gest, I had hosted all of the <i>Night of 100 Stars </i>presentations he had produced during the 1990s. In return, he had made generous donations to the Motion Picture Home in Natalie's name. For the <i>Night of 100 Stars </i>productions, which had been backed by Michael Jackson, David uncovered people who hadn't been seen for decades: Turhan Bey, Clayton Moore, Silvia Sydney, Fay Wray, Eleanor Powellstars of silent movies- archaeology combined with showmanship. No one could have done it better than David.</p><p>The date of the wedding was March 16, 2002. The ceremony was scheduled for late afternoon, but we were all asked to be in black tie. I was sitting next to Robert Osborne, a close friend and the longtime host of Turner Classic Movies. All the guests were punctual, because David and Liza were determined that it wouldn't be one of those Hollywood weddings that start late. Even Michael Jackson was on time.</p><p>But Elizabeth Taylor, one of the two matrons of honor, was late. No surprise there. Elizabeth was always-and I do mean <i>always� </i>late. And once she finally did arrive, she realized that no one had brought the shoes she wanted to wear, so she sent someone back to the hotel on upper Fifth Avenue to fetch them. The church, needless to say, was on lower Fifth Avenue. Somewhere in the middle, a parade was taking place.</p><p>So we sat there.</p><p>Twenty minutes, and we still sat there. A half hour, and we sat there.</p><p>After a while people stopped looking at their watches. And we sat some more.</p><p>There really wasn't anything to do but look around the church. "We" included Donald Trump, Mickey Rooney, Tito Jackson (co best man, along with Michael), Gina Lollobrigida, Lauren Bacall, Natalie Cole, Mia Farrow, Cindy Adams, Martha Stewart, Liz Smith, and 842 more of David and Liz a's most intimate friends.</p><p>Bob Osborne and I discussed whether Liza had ever met Gina Lollobrigida before her wedding day. We decided it was highly doubtful.</p><p>Now, I have always had the greatest affection for Elizabeth. I first met her in the late r94os at a party thrown by Roddy McDowall, her best friend for life. Everything that people say about Elizabeth's looks was truth: she was just illegally beautiful. Years later, Elizabeth and I had a fling, and years after that, I produced and costarred in a movie with her, <i>There Must Be a Pony, </i>based on James Kirkwood Jr.'s fictionalized memoir of his mother, the silent star Lila Lee.</p><p>I've always believed that Elizabeth was a terribly underrated ac� tress, and I've always known that she was among the most generous people alive-not just with money, but with the most valuable commodity any of us possesses: her time.</p><p>But Elizabeth had her flaws as we all do. Foremost among them that she was oblivious to the concept of punctuality. A wait of one or two hours was normal for people waiting for Elizabeth. I've always wondered whether it was a passive-aggressive way of asserting herself for all those years of enforced punctuality at MGM. But she was never late on our picture.</p><p>Unless she really, really liked you, Elizabeth was always late.</p><p>And sometimes she was incredibly late even if she did like you. So I wasn't terribly shocked when, even after the gofer arrived back at the church with the correct shoes, we were still sitting there.</p><p>David Gest was growing noticeably perturbed, so he asked Michael Jackson to go find Elizabeth and bring her back alive. Neither David nor Liza wanted to personally force the issue, since they were so pleased that Elizabeth had agreed to come in the first place. Elizabeth was going through one of her bad phases-overweight and not looking good.</p><p>Michael disappeared into the room where Elizabeth was supposedly getting ready, while one of his bodyguards stood watch outside.</p><p>And then we waited some more.</p><p>By now the wedding was an hour late and counting.</p><p>I asked a man what the holdup was, but he just shrugged and said that Elizabeth was in a room with Michael Jackson.</p><p>Nobody seemed to be moving, and nobody seemed eager to break up whatever was going on in the waiting room. Because I knew Elizabeth so well, I was finally deputized to get Michael away from her so the wedding could proceed. Otherwise we all might find ourselves growing old, very slowly, at the Marble Collegiate Church.</p><p>I walked past the bodyguard and into the room.</p><p>Elizabeth was sitting there, gazing at Michael. Michael was on his knees, gazing at Elizabeth. He was holding her hand. Nothing was being said. He was besotted with her; he was drinking her in. "Michael," I said, "we have to get the wedding started. We <i>have</i> to get going."</p><p>"I want to be with Elizabeth," Michael said in that weird, whispery voice. "I <i>love </i>Elizabeth."</p><p>Talking to Michael when he was in one of his reveries was exactly like talking to a six-year-old waiting up for Santa Claus: you didn't want to disabuse him of his fantasy, but you had to firmly lead him away from the Christmas tree so that the presents could be put out. "I love her, too, Michael," I said. "We all love her. But we have to go ahead with the wedding. There's a church full of people out there, and they're getting restless. You can spend all the time you want with Elizabeth after the wedding."</p><p>Full disclosure: I was angry, so I might have said all this a little ... brusquely. By this time I was heartily sick of the wedding, even though it hadn't even taken place yet. What I wanted to do was have a drink with Bob Osborne and not be bothered by infantile bullshit.</p><p>I got them moving, but Elizabeth came out on the wrong side of the church-the guests were divided into men on the left and women on the right-and so she had to walk all the way around behind the pews. Since Elizabeth was fairly immobile and walked with difficulty-part of it was her back, part of it was the medica�tion for her back, which always gave her a buzz-she had to be helped onto the altar.</p><p>Finally--finally-the wedding got under way. David gave Liza a 3�s-karat diamond ring from Tiffany's. After the minister said he could kiss the bride, David tried to suck the lips off Liza's face. I was too appalled to say anything. Jill said, <i>"Ewww." </i>Next to her, Liz Smith said, "Double <i>ewwww."</i></p><p>The reception afterward was huge. Andy Williams sang. Gloria Gaynor sang. Michael Jackson gave the toast. I noticed some people I hadn't noticed at the wedding: Kirk Douglas, Joan Collins, and Sid Luft, one ofLiza's stepfathers. Elizabeth had skipped the reception. I finally had my drink with Bob Osborne.</p><p>For a long time after that, David would call Jill and me to chat.</p><p>"You two are the happiest people I know," he would begin, "and now I've found the same thing. I'm so in love with her. I go to bed with her and I rest my head on her right breast." Then Liza would come on the line and tell me how wonderful David was, and that she was finally, unbelievably happy. They were nuts about each other.</p><p>They divorced in 2007. It was, needless to say, acrimonious. For a while David lived in England; now I understand that he's in Nashville.</p><p>That was the day I began to think seriously about the business in which I have spent my life. Ever since then, I've felt that while the wedding was not exactly a Fellini movie, it was close.</p><p>And it was then that I began thinking about how show business had changed.</p><p>Now, Judy Garland's marriage to Vincente Minnelli was probably not any more plausible than Liza's to David Gest. But the difference is that the former had been designed and directed by MGM so as to minimize damage to the reputations of a major star and a major di� rector. The full extent of the emotional, psychological, and sexual misalliance between Judy and Vincente didn't become apparent until years later, after they had left the protective shelter of the studio.</p><p>It needs to be pointed out that David was in many respects very good for Liza. He got her thin; he got her performing again. But Liza's way with men derives from her mother's. She's neurotic and she's beguiling. She would put her life in someone's hands and convince him that he was the only one who could possibly save her. At some point, either David became too exhausted to carry on or the intrinsic problems in the relationship reared up and destroyed the marriage.</p><p>Eleven years after that wedding, things are ... even more bizarre. Recently I was idly watching TV when a formerly thin ac� tress who'd become fat, then thin and back again in what is apparently an endlessly recurring cycle, showed up to promote a reality show. Since she's now fat, nobody hires her to act, because there aren't a lot of parts for middle-aged fat women, movies and TV being predominantly a medium of fantasy.</p><p>So her only means of making a living is appearing as a formerly thin actress grown fat who is trying to get thin again.</p><p>I turned to Jill and asked a question: "This is a career?"</p><p>I didn't really expect an answer, which is good, because I didn't get one. Some questions don't have answers. And I'm compelled to admit that being a fat actress and playing oneself is not really a bad gig. If nothing else, she's working. Intermittently, but still, she's working.</p><p>All this got me thinking about the quantum differences be� tween now and then-then being right after World War II, when I got into the movies. And it got me thinking not just about the movies themselves, but about the differences in Hollywood, the town I've been a part of for seventy-five years.</p><p>On the most basic level, the difference is 180 degrees. For in� stance, when I worked on <i>The Longest Day </i>for Darryl Zanuck, he commanded a huge force of actors and extras, and the film was shot on the actual locations, at Omaha Beach and so forth.</p><p>Darryl organized his version of the D-day landing by flying green flags for ''Attack," yellow flags for "Caution," and red flags for "Stop." I was in the sequence about rappelling up Pointe du Hoc, and we shot it at Pointe du Hoc, doing it exactly the way the Amer�ican soldiers had done it less than twenty years before.</p><p>Today when a battle scene is mounted, the extra call is greatly diminished, and the body count and the effects are completed and amplified through the oddly weightless effects of computer generated images (CGI). Through some inverted math, the numbers of the combatants are incalculably greater, but the effect is halved, because you don't really believe what you're seeing. The pervasive lack of reality of so much modern filmmaking has made spectacle less spectacular.</p><p>Back then, we worked a six-day week, there was no such thing as overtime, and the large board at the studio that contained the shoot�ing schedule for each picture on the lot was rarely altered-if Darryl wanted a movie made in forty days and you fell a little behind, then you could confidently expect to be pulling an all-nighter on that fortieth day because it would, by God, be done in the allotted time.</p><p>When I started out, I worked in front of a camera filled with film, and each take was signaled by the <i>slap! </i>of a clapper board, which was used to synch the sound. Today, the cameras are all digital, with no gentle but comforting <i>whirrr </i>of the camera, and the "clapper board" offers only a digital readout.</p><p>And I can assure you that if an actress got too fat at Darryl Zanuck's place of business-or, for that matter, Jack Warner's or Louis B. Mayer's-the studio would not have dropped her any faster than if she had contracted a venereal disease and infected half the studio.</p><p>Certain things weren't done, and fat was one of them. Nor were there a lot of alternatives to the movies. TV was further down the food chain, with less money and less prestige, although that began to change in the r96os.</p><p>In the golden days of Hollywood, stars didn't have much, if any, say over the parts we played, or, for that matter, over what movies we made. In fact, even famous executives like Zanuck and Mayer weren't truly autonomous-Hollywood always had a way of an�swering to New York on matters of budget and overall policy.</p><p>Following this train of thought, I've realized that people in the movie industry, whether actors, directors, or producers, used to exercise real control only over their private lives. But even then things could be heavily monitored, as Judy Garland found out.</p><p>And all this is what has brought me to this book about the quantum differences between then and now, as seen in how we lived our private lives during the last gasp of radiance that was the studio system. I want to try to document a way of life that has vanished as surely as birch bark canoes. And I want to do this before the colors fade.</p><p>It cannot be overemphasized that the movie industry of the late 1940s was a family business. Jack and Harry Warner were running Warner Bros. just as they had been since World War I; Harry Cohn was running Columbia just as he had since shortly after that war; Louis B. Mayer was running MGM just as he had since the company was formed in 1924.</p><p>These men knew one another intimately, distrusted one another greatly, competed against one another constantly. They engaged in the kind of bitter squabbles and fights-at times physical-that can be understood only as family quarrels. Eventually, these men were squeezed out-by time, by death, once or twice by each other. I think it's fair to say that, at least at Hollywood's beginnings, they were too busy to really be conscious of what they were building, but they certainly believed in themselves, so they built something that has lasted. More important, they made movies that will undoubtedly outlast the studios that financed them.</p><p>For all their at times petty vindictiveness, those brawling, hostile, often ill- educated men stood behind the movies that came from their studios in a way that the far more educated and sophisticated people who run the studios today don't. Warner and Cohn, Mayer and Zukor, Goldwyn and the rest made movies they genuinely believed in; they made movies they wanted to see themselves. They took pride in the product.</p><p>For them, their work was intensely personal-a reflection of their dreams and aspirations.</p><p>The Harvard MBAs who run the multinational corporations who own the studios today don't make movies for themselves. They make movies for an audience they don't know and probably don't want to know. They might be proud of their quarterly earnings, but, in most cases, they can't possibly be proud of their movies.</p><p>And while I'm on the subject, let me just s...</p></p><h2>War in Human Civilization</h2><p>In this truly global study, major military historian Azar Gat sets out to unravel the &#34;riddle of war&#34; throughout human history, from the early hunter-gatherers right through to the unconventional terrorism of the twenty-first century.

Spanning the full breadth of the continent, from the bloody revolt in Algiers against the French to Zimbabwe's civil war, Martin Meredith's classic history focuses on the key personalities, events and themes of the independence era, and explains the myriad problems that Africa has faced in the past half-century. It covers recent events like the ongoing conflict in Sudan, the controversy over Western aid, the exploitation of Africa's resources, and the growing importance and influence of China.</p><p><b>Martin Meredith</b> is a journalist, biographer, and historian who has written extensively on Africa. His books include<i> Mandela: A Biography</i>; <i>Mugabe</i>; <i>Diamonds, Gold and War</i>; <i>Born in Africa</i>; and, most recently, <i>Fortunes of Africa</i>. He lives near Oxford, England."Though today an independent scholar, Meredith was one of those now-too-rare journalists who knew his beat intimately, having lived on and off (mostly on) in Africa for 40 years, informing a keen and humane mind with all things African. It shows here in the depth and fluid familiarity of his narrative, light on its feet for so wildly complex a picture. Meredith isn't afraid of venturing an opinion, but what he dines on are basic realities: who did what when, and the consequences. These he spreads before his readers, for them to draw their own, now also informed, conclusions."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>San Francisco Chronicle</b></i><br></i></b><br><br>"For the author, even organizing this information is a hugely daunting job. How can such vast amounts of information be analyzed for the reader? One way was to follow parallel developments in different places-which is more or less how Mr. Meredith works, with attention to the hair-trigger ways in which one coup or crisis could set off subsequent disasters. He is able to steer the book firmly without compromising its hard-won clarity." <br>&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>New York Times<br></b></i></i></b><br><br>"The Fate of Africa is a comprehensive, wonderfully readable survey of the entire continent's recent past. . . .

It also includes many lists, tables, illustrations and photos Bonnie is also an accomplished artist! Between the covers you will find information on common complications as well as very obscure ones that hopefully you will never see. It covers complications that occur in pregnancy, birth and postpartum, with help on what to do and when to refer care.<br> Bonnie has excellent discussions of critical thinking in emergencies, how to manage, co-manage or refer as well as a great epilogue on the herstory of midwifery. Some other chapters include bleeding and hemorrhage, pain, hypertensive disorders, trauma and shock, preterm labor, multiple gestation, malpresentations and shoulder dystocia, fetal heart monitoring and neonatal resuscitation. This book is an excellent resource for all birth practitioners. The only thing I found missing is discussion of the importance of nutrition in correcting and avoiding complications.<br> If something unusual is occurring, this book will give you the information to explain to your client what is likely going on with her and her baby. When a complication comes up, it is important to remember mom is still having a baby; that is, she having a miracle. The rest of her care needs to be CARE. In any case, this book will give you the information you need to serve mothers and babies well.<br> As midwives our role is to ascertain normality, or to help get a woman into the normal range with information, knowledge and techniques. BEST has all of these. Doulas and childbirth educators can use this book, too. Often they are the only ones who will explain situations to the women they serve, this book potentially has a larger role among other practitioners.

Yet there were also constant tensions and disagreements that threatened to pull the alliance apart. This book highlights why the unprecedented level of cooperation between the very different American and British forces eventually led to victory but also emphasizes the tensions and controversies which inevitably arose. Based on considerable archival research on both sides of the Atlantic, this work considers the breadth and depth of the relationship from high-level strategic decisions, the rivalries and personalities of the commanders to the ordinary British and American soldiers who fought alongside one another. The book also looks back and demonstrates how the legacy of previous experience shaped the decisions of the war. <p><em>Eisenhower's Armies</em> is the story of two very different armies learning to live, work, and fight together even in the face of serious strategic disagreements. The book is also a very human story about the efforts of many individuals&#x2015;famous or otherwise&#x2015;who worked and argued together to defeat Hitler&#x2019;s Germany. In highlighting the cooperation, tensions, and disagreements inherent in this military alliance, this work shows that Allied victory was far from pre-ordained and proves that the business of making this alliance work was vital for eventual success. Thus this dynamic new history provides a fresh perspective on many of the controversies and critical strategic decisions of World War II. As such, this book provides expert analysis of the Anglo-American military alliance as well as new insights into the &#x2018;special relationship&#x2019; of the mid-twentieth century.</p> 16 pages of B&amp;W photographs</p><p>Niall Barr is a Senior Lecturer in Defence Studies at the Defence Studies Department, King&#39;s College, London.

Today, fashion marketing influences all products and how consumers use these products. How products are marketed, when products are marketed, the evolution of products into different sizes, shapes, colors, and uses are all influenced by fashion marketers. Fashion marketing is taken to different levels from branding a person (e.g., Ralph Lauren, the person), a line of products (e.g., Lexus luxury cars), or a single product (e.g., Coach handbag).

Do they constitute lineal ancestors or a separate evolutionary branch? Were they exterminated or absorbed by humans about 30,000 years ago? Interpretations of the evidence excite strenuous debate among the experts, as chronicled in James Shreeve's <i>The Neandertal Enigma</i> , so what's a curious amateur to make of the brouhaha? That's where Tattersall (also a museum curator) excels as he conveys the essentials of the technical literature to the public. These consist of methods by which Neanderthal sites are dated, what inferences may be drawn from the fossils' anatomy, and for background, a narrative of current knowledge about the hominid line. Abundant full-page photos of specimens and archaeological digs cement Tattersall's clarity on the topic, making this an immeasurable aid to students and armchair anthropologists alike. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>The Making of Meaning: Metaphors, Models, and Maxims for Writing Teachers</h2><p>The Making of Meaning: Metaphors, Models, and Maxims for Writing Teachers</p><p></p><h2>Gravitation</h2><p>1-forms compared and contrasted</p><p><p>"<i>Gravitation</i> is a classic."<b>--David Spergel, Princeton University</b></p><p>"<i>Gravitation</i> is the encyclopedic, definitive exposition of general relativity as of 1970.

Is eating organic or free range sufficient to change the moral equation? Is there a moral cost in not eating meat? As billions of animals continue to be raised and killed by human beings for human consumption, affecting the significance and urgency in answering these questions grow.<br><br>This volume collects twelve new essays by leading moral philosophers who address the difficult questions surrounding meat eating by examining various implications and consequences of our food choices. Some argue for the moral permissibility of eating meat by suggesting views such as farm animals would not exist and flourish otherwise, and the painless death that awaits is no loss to them. Others consider more specific examples like whether buying french fries at McDonalds is just as problematic as ordering a Big Mac due to the action's indirect support of a major purveyor of meat. <em>The Moral</em> <em>Complexities of Eating Meat</em> is a stimulating contribution to the ongoing debate on meat consumption and actively challenges readers to reevlaute their stand on food and animal ethics.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ben Bramble</strong> received his PhD in philosophy from the University of Sydney in 2014.

The Moral Complexities of Eating Meat not only brilliantly captures the deepest nuances of this debate, but, through consistently deft prose, it brings the issue to the core of our ongoing discussion about what to eat. The essays in this volume do what the best moral philosophy does: It destabilizes ideas-important, defining, crucial ideas-that we have once assumed to be permanently settled. Concerned consumers-be they vegan, vegetarian, 'unreflective carnivore,' hunter, forager, roadkill devotee, and so on-will leave these essays without having experienced something of a tectonic shift in the way they think about animal products.

Twenty-four hours later, she escaped, but within that brief period, her body had been burned with cigarettes, she'd been raped, beaten and forced to torture a woman who was already near death. As a consequence of her devastation, Ortiz lost every memory she had of her life before the kidnapping, and spent years battling both real and remembered demons in a struggle to heal herself and to spread the word about U.S. complicity in Guatemala's repressive political system and in the torture and murder of thousands of innocent Guatemalans. This is an important book for two reasons: its illustration of the fallout of torture and the special needs of survivors, and Ortiz's well-documented narrative of the U.S. government's refusal to take seriously what happened to her, particularly as she identified one of her torturers as an American. It's unfortunate that Ortiz didn't have a better editor. This is a powerful story and Ortiz (aided by Davis, communications director of the Guatemala Human Rights Commission) is a strong writer, but the avalanche of detail will confuse readers, and material such as the text of speeches and memos could have been included in an appendix. But Ortiz's determination to tell the truth in spite of ongoing threats and her own fear makes this book, despite its flaws, impossible to dismiss. Photos not seen by PW.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.In the 1980s Sister Dianna Ortiz went to Guatemala to help citizens victimized by one of the world's most oppressive regimes. As a result, she nearly became one of the <i>disperdicios</i>, or the disappeared, called that because they literally disappeared into the night to be raped, tortured, and murdered, never to be seen alive again by their families. Sister Dianna was one of the more fortunate victims of this regime in that her ordeal was relatively brief--and she survived. He book focuses on the long-term effects of her ordeal more than the gory details of what she suffered. But it is about more than just the torture of Sister Dianna or the other <i>disperdicios</i>. It also puts their suffering in context by examining what allowed these things to happen. Sister Dianna's story will interest anyone wishing to understand how rape and torture break down the human spirit, and how it is possible to survive such assaults. Students of political science will also find this book intriguing. <i>June Pulliam</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

C. Wyeth enhance this large-format edition of Daniel Defoe&#39;s classic tale. The thrilling saga of the English sailor marooned on a desert island, originally published in 1719, is retold here for children aged 4 to 8, who will be captivated by the castaway&#39;s adventures and struggle for survival.</p><p>Daniel Defoe (1660-1731) was born in London. He was a merchant, soldier, journalist, and secret agent for William III. Throughout his life he wrote hundreds of books and pamphlets on social, political and economic topics. Originally published in 1719, Robinson Crusoe was based partly on the autobiography of a real-life castaway - Alexander Selkirk. Steve Zorn is a former editor of Running Press. He has written other children&#39;s classics (Courage) in the 9.98 format such as The Classic Book of Best-loved Bedtime Stories; Mostly Ghostly; Eight Spooky Tales to Chill Your Bones; Mostly Monsters; Eight Terrifying Tales to Tingle Your Spine; and Start Exploring[trademark] Masterpieces. N.C. Wyeth (1882-1945) was an American illustrator and painter. His best known illustrations are for Defoe&#39;s Robinson Crusoe, Stevenson&#39;s novels (Treasure Island, Kidnapped, The Black Arrow) and an edition of Robin Hood.<b>From L. J. Swingle's Introduction to <i>Robinson Crusoe</i></b><p>People who have never actually read Daniel Defoe's <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> often think of it as a children's book. It is a tale, so they suppose, that belongs on the shelf upstairs in the playroom alongside Lassie, the Hardy Boys books, and Charlotte's Web. But to discover the fallacy of this notion we need only sit down with a child and start trying to read the book. Reading <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> to a child usually turns out to be a different, somewhat less amiable adventure than telling the child about <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> in our own words. The child can eagerly attend to our retelling of the Crusoe story, relatively inept storytellers though we may be. The experiences of a man shipwrecked alone on a desert island-his initial fears, his efforts to escape, his struggle to secure food and shelter, his discovery of a footprint in the sand-all these things take powerful hold on a child's imagination. But if plunged into Defoe's original narrative of Crusoe's experiences, a child immediately senses that the waters of storytelling have suddenly gotten uncomfortably deep, that the exciting shallows of the story as Mom or Dad would tell it at bedtime have been left behind, that many things going on around the margins of the adventure story in Defoe's book are not attractively adventurous. How can a person possibly wade through this strange book that pretends to be <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>? Some sort of incomprehensible adult trickery must be going on here.</p><p>Published in 1719, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> is a novel for grown-up minds that has been kidnapped for, though obviously not by, the kids. In this respect it's interestingly akin to another supposed children's book that would be published midway into the next century, Lewis Carroll's <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> (1865). Like Crusoe, Alice presents us with the story of a person transported from our own familiar world into foreign territory that offers opportunity for exciting adventure, obviously, but also for an encounter with some complex intellectual issues. A child, responding eagerly to the adventure but brought up short by the intellectual issues, is likely to sense immediately that neither Crusoe nor Alice is a book for the playroom. Both belong in the library downstairs, where adults retreat to contemplate the shadowy mysteries of their own minds and experience.</p><p>Once we adults rescue <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> from the playroom and begin thinking about its significance for ourselves, it is helpful to consider some things we might expect to find in the novel that either do not appear there at all or that appear in unfamiliar forms. Writing <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> in the early years of the eighteenth century, Defoe reveals himself to be in several important respects not quite of our mind. True, he's an intellectual precursor of the modern mind and, as such, some aspects of his basic interests and values are relatively close to our own. Rudiments of the Crusoe story exert considerable contemporary popular appeal, and not just to small children. Many movie adaptations have been made of the story. In the last few years alone, for example, we've had Aidan Quinn play Crusoe in a 1988 film of that name; we've had Pierce Brosnan, of James Bond fame, play Crusoe in the 1996 <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>; we've had Tom Hanks play a rather interesting loose translation of Crusoe as a plane-wrecked Federal Express man in the 2000 film Cast Away. The name "Robinson Crusoe" itself has entered the public domain; like "Gatsby," "Tarzan," "Superman," and "Mickey Mouse," it has become a useful shorthand term in contemporary popular thought, meaningful to people who have never encountered the literary source.</p><p>But if we go back to the novel <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> and see what Defoe made of the story in 1719, we run into some intriguing basic differences from common inclinations of thought in more recent centuries. These differences constitute an important part of what makes <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> not simply entertaining-occasionally almost more puzzling, or even more irritating than entertaining-but thereby greatly worth reading for the mind's sake.</p></p><h2>John Updike: Novels 1959-1965 (LOA #311): The Poorhouse Fair / Rabbit, Run / The Centaur / Of the Farm (Library of America John Updike Edition)</h2><p><b>Library of America launches its definitive multi-volume edition of John Updike's novels with the four early works that signaled the arrival of one of the most gifted young novelists of the 1960s.</b><br><br>John Updike had already made a name as a contributor of stories and poems to <i>The New Yorker</i> when, in January 1959, at the age of twenty-six, he published his first novel, <i>The Poorhouse Fair</i>, launching one of the most extraordinary literary careers in American letters. Now, Library of America inaugurates a multi-volume edition of Updike's novels with this volume gathering his first four novels, including the landmark <i>Rabbit, Run</i>, chosen in 2010 by TIME Magazine one of the best 100 novels published in English since 1923. Set in the near future of 1978, <i>The Poorhouse Fair</i> stages a conflict between John Hook, a rebellious ninety-four-year-old former schoolteacher now a resident of a rural poorhouse, and young Mr. Conner, the utilitarian humanist who runs the facility, as an allegory of resistance in a world of systems and efficiencies. Updike's legendary rejoinder to Jack Kerouac's <i>On the Road</i>, <i>Rabbit, Run</i> (1960) introduces us to the author's most enduring protagonist, Harry "Rabbit" Angstrom, a onetime high-school basketball star who, on an impulse, deserts his wife and son, with tragic consequences. <i>The Centaur</i>, a comic-tragic father-son novel that mixes memory and myth, won the National Book Award for Fiction in 1964. The novella <i>Of the Farm</i> (1965) is one of Updike's loveliest performances, a kind of chamber music for four voices set during a single memorable weekend.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

Twenty years later, Adorno wrote: "how much of my writing will remain is beyond my knowledge or my control, but there is one claim I wish to stake: that I understand the language of birds," It was no less than the desire to learn to speak this language that drew him to Berg. Adorno already knew what he wanted to drew to compose before he went to Berg, and the aim of his stay in Vienna and the following years was to learn to put this knowledge of musical composition into practice.<br> <p>His correspondence with Berg, who was soon to be world famous, is partly defined by his engagement with the compositional problems posed for the musical avant-garde by Schoenberg&#x2019;s discovery of the twelve-tone technique, for which Adorno was to become an advocate, not least in Vienna and through Berg. This correspondence documents how he wrote numerous essays on Berg, Webern and Schoenberg during this time, and tried in vain to establish a platform for the Second Viennese School against "moderated modernity" in the journal Anbruch, where he exerted considerable editorial influence. It also shows how much Adorno &#x2013; continually admonished by Berg to focus only on his musical composition &#x2013; strove to reconcile his academic duties and his literary and journalistic work with the constant which to do nothing more than compose.</p></p><p><b>Theodor W. Adorno</b> and <b>Alban Berg</b>"These letters provide us with a unique overview of the period and offer interesting and enlightening perspectives on even mundane aspects of daily life, as well as bringing us closer to the characters in question by allowing us a special insight into thir peculiar foibles and eccentricities."<br> <i><b>Musical Times</b></i> <p>"Major composers who befriend major philosophers, and vice-versa, are hardly numerous in the history of Western culture. Alban Berg's relationship with Theodor W. Adorno as teacher and colleague ranks with that between Richard Wagner and Friedrich Nietzsche, with the difference that Berg's and Adorno's genuine affection for each other, and their magnificent insight into each other&#x2019;s work, remained constant to the end. Their correspondence is one of the landmarks of the early twentieth century and its music &#x2013; a beacon of light in desperate times."<b><br> John Deathridge, <i>King&#x2019;s College London</i></b></p> <p>"Sensitively translated and skillfully edited, the Adorno-Berg Correspondence represents scholarship eminently worthy of this extraordinary collection of letters between two twentieth-century intellectual-artistic giants. Adorno's composition lessons with Berg lasted for only a few months, but the impact transformed his understanding of modern music in particular and aesthetics in general. Berg, in turn, respected his pupil&#x2019;s abilities as a composer, just as he clearly benefited, both intellectually and emotionally, from young Adorno&#x2019;s profound insight into his master&#x2019;s music. Though separated in age by nearly two decades, the two men formed a relationship born of deep affection and still deeper shared respect that lasted until Berg's untimely and sudden death. The collected correspondence makes available for the first time in English a body of texts that will add significantly to our understanding of Adorno and Berg as well as their breathtaking accomplishments."<br> <b>Richard Leppert, <i>University of Minnesota</i></b></p></p><h2>The Addiction Counselor&#39;s Desk Reference</h2><p>The Addiction Counselor's Desk Reference is a comprehensive compilation of information about the full spectrum of addictive disorders, their consequences, and treatment.

But there is another, secret Dona who longs for freedom, honest love - and sweetness, even if it is spiced with danger.</p><p>To escape the shallowness of court life, Dona retreats to Navron, her husband's remote Cornish estate. There, she seeks peace in its solitary woods and hidden creeks. But she finds instead a daring pirate, hunted by all Cornwall, a Frenchman who, like Dona, would gamble his life for a moment's joy.</p><p>Together, they embark upon a quest rife with danger and glory, one which bestows upon Dona the ultimate choice: sacrifice her lover to certain death or risk her own life to save him.</p><br><p><strong>One of the last century's most original literary talents -<i>Daily Telegraph</i></strong></p></p><p><p>Daphne du Maurier (1907-89) was born in London, the daughter of the famous actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and granddaughter of George du Maurier, the author and artist. In 1931 her first novel,<i>The Loving Spirit</i>, was published. A biography of her father and three other novels followed, but it was the novel<i>Rebecca</i>that launched her into the literary stratosphere and made her one of the most popular authors of her day. In 1932, du Maurier married Major Frederick Browning, with whom she had three children.<br>Many of du Maurier's bestselling novels and short stories were adapted into award-winning films, including Alfred Hitchcock's<i>The Birds</i>and Nicolas Roeg's<i>Don't Look Now</i>.

The short seas break above the bar at ebb-tide, and the waders fly inland to the mud-flats, their wings skimming the surface, and calling to one another as they go. Only the gulls remain, wheeling and crying above the foam, diving now and again in search of food, their grey feathers glistening with the salt spray. </p> <p>The long rollers of the Channel, travelling from beyond Lizard point, follow hard upon the steep seas at the river mouth, and mingling with the surge and wash of deep sea water comes the brown tide, swollen with the last rains and brackish from the mud, bearing upon its face dead twigs and straws, and strange forgotten things, leaves too early fallen, young birds, and the buds of flowers.</p> <p>The open roadstead is deserted, for an east wind makes uneasy anchorage, and but for the few houses scattered here and there above Helford passage, and the group of bungalows about Port Navas, the river would be the same as it was in a century now forgotten, in a time that has left few memories.</p> <p>In those days the hills and the valleys were alone in splendour, there were no buildings to desecrate the rough fields and cliffs, no chimney pots to peer out of the tall woods. There were a few cottages in Helford hamlet, but they made no impression upon the river life itself, which belonged to the birds &#x2014; curlew and redshank, guillemot and puffin. No yachts rode to the tide then, as they do to-day, and that stretch of placid water where the river divides to Constantine and Gweek was calm and undisturbed.</p> <p>The river was little known, save to a few mariners who had found shelter there when the south-west gales drove them inshore from their course up-channel, and they found the place lonely and austere, a little frightening because of the silence, and when the wind was fair again were glad to weigh anchor and set sail. Helford hamlet was no inducement to a sailor ashore, the few cottage folk dull-witted and uncommunicative, and the fellow who has been away from warmth and women over-long has little desire to wander in the woods or dabble with the waders in the mud at ebb-tide. So the winding river remained unvisited, the woods and the hills untrodden, and all the drowsy beauty of midsummer that gives Helford river a strange enchantment was never seen and never known.</p> <p>To-day there are many voices to blunder in upon the silence. The pleasure steamers come and go, leaving a churning wake, and yachtsmen visit one another, and even the day-tripper, his dull eye surfeited with undigested beauty, ploughs in and out amongst the shallows, a prawning net in hand. Sometimes, in a little puffing car, he jerks his way along the uneven, muddy track that leads sharply to the right out of Helford village, and takes his tea with his fellow-trippers in the stone kitchen of the old farm building that once was Navron House. There is something of grandeur about it even now. Part of the original quadrangle still stands, enclosing the farm-yard of to-day, and the two pillars that once formed the entrance to the house, now over-grown with ivy and encrusted with lichen, serve as props to the modern barn with its corrugated roof.</p> <p>The farm kitchen, where the tripper takes his tea, was part of Navron dining-hall, and the little half-stair, now terminating in a bricked-up wall, was the stair leading to the gallery. The rest of the house must have crumbled away, or been demolished, for the square farm-building, though handsome enough, bears little likeness to the Navron of the old prints, shaped like the letter E, and of the formal garden and the park there is no trace to-day.</p> <p>The tripper eats his split and drinks his tea, smiling upon the landscape, knowing nothing of the woman who stood there once, long ago, in another summer, who caught the gleam of the river amidst the trees, as he does, and who lifted her head to the sky and felt the sun.</p> <p>He hears the homely farm-yard noises, the clanking of pails, the lowing of cattle, the rough voices of the farmer and his son as they call to each other across the yard, but his ears are deaf to the echoes of that other time, when someone whistled softly from the dark belt of trees, his hands cupped to his mouth, and was swiftly answered by the thin, stooping figure crouching beneath the walls of the silent house, while above them the casement opened, and Dona watched and listened, her hands playing a little nameless melody upon the sill, her ringlets falling forward over her face.</p> <p>The river flows on, the trees rustle in the summer wind, and down on the mud flats the oyster-catchers stand at ebb-tide scanning the shallows for food, and the curlews cry, but the men and women of that other time are forgotten, their headstones encrusted with lichen and moss, their names indecipherable.</p> <p>To-day the cattle stamp and churn the earth over the vanished porch of Navron House, where once a man stood as the clock struck midnight, his face smiling in the dim candlelight, his drawn sword in his hand.</p> <p>In spring the farmer's children gather primroses and snowdrops in the banks above the creek, their muddy boots snapping the dead twigs and the fallen leaves of a spent summer, and the creek itself, swollen with the rains of a long winter, looks desolate and grey.</p> <p>The trees still crowd thick and darkly to the water's edge, and the moss is succulent and green upon the little quay where Dona built her fire and looked across the flames and laughed at her lover, but to-day no ship lies at anchor in the pool, with rakish masts pointing to the skies, there is no rattle of chain through the hawse hole, no rich tobacco smell upon the air, no echo of voices coming across the water in a lilting foreign tongue.</p> <p>The solitary yachtsman who leaves his yacht in the open roadstead of Helford, and goes exploring up river in his dinghy on a night in midsummer, when the night-jars call, hesitates when he comes upon the mouth of the creek, for there is something of mystery about it even now, something of enchantment. Being a stranger, the yachtsman looks back over his shoulder to the safe yacht in the roadstead, and to the broad waters of the river, and he pauses, resting on his paddles, aware suddenly of the deep silence of the creek, of its narrow twisting channel, and he feels &#x2014; for no reason known to him &#x2014; that he is an interloper, a trespasser in time. He ventures a little way along the left bank of the creek, the sound of the blades upon the water seeming over-loud and echoing oddly amongst the trees on the farther bank, and as he creeps forward the creek narrows, the trees crowd yet more thickly to the water's edge, and he feels a spell upon him, fascinating, strange, a thing of queer excitement not fully understood.</p> (20090421)</p><h2>Chinese Qigong Massage: General Massage</h2><p>Invigorating and restorative massage techniques both for self and with a partner.</p><p></p><h2>The Best Year of Your Marriage: 52 Devotions to Bring You Closer</h2><p>This beautiful 52-week devotional provides Christian couples with an easy way to read Scripture, pray, and engage in spiritual discussions and activities to strengthen their relationship and marriage.

Pomerantz, author of Where Peachtree Meets Sweet Auburn<br><br>""The skills of writing and reporting that fans of Ron Rapoport, like me, have come to expect from him over the years--candor, thoughtfulness, insight, perspective, humor--are once again demonstrated and illuminated in The Immortal Bobby. It is an important book about an important sports figure that, typically for Rapoport, goes beyond the confines of sports and fits firmly in the context of our culture.""<br>--Ira Berkow, sports columnist and author of Red: A Biography of Red Smith<br><br>""Here is Bobby Jones as you've never seen him, almost fearful in the fires of competition, and Ron Rapoport shows us how that man became a legend.""<br>--Dave Kindred, coauthor (with Tom Callahan) of Around the World in 18 Holes</p><p>Of all the giants of golf's Golden Age, Bobby Jones was the most revered. His intelligence, modesty, eloquence, and charm&#x2014;and the fact he remained an amateur throughout his career&#x2014;so completely captivated the public that at times it seemed almost beside the point that he was also the best golfer in the world. Jones's fame reached its peak in 1930 when he became the only golfer ever to win the Grand Slam and the only person in history to receive a second ticker-tape parade on Broadway. Two months later, he shocked the sports world by announcing his retirement.<p>Yet beneath the easy grace he exhibited on and off the golf course, there was another Bobby Jones&#x2014;one who through the years battled his volatile temper; the pressure of competition that grew so unbearable he was often left near tears and unable to take any pleasure in winning; and, in the final decades of his life, an agonizing physical decline that robbed him of everything but his dignity.</p><p>Now, drawing upon scores of interviews, a careful reconstruction of contemporary accounts, and Jones's voluminous correspondence, award-winning sportswriter Ron Rapoport reveals the man behind the legend. The Immortal Bobby shows that on the golf course, Jones was capable of some of the most brilliant shots ever struck&#x2014;and of sensational blunders and unthinking lapses that were never more evident than during his quest for the Grand Slam. It shows the gracious champion who set the standard for sportsmanship and fair play&#x2014;and the bearer of an implacable grudge against another great golfer who had wronged him.</p><p>Rapoport also re-creates an era when golf rose from an unfamiliar game born in Scotland to one of America's most popular pastimes. He depicts Jones's colorful and so-often frustrated opponents, visits each of the Grand Slam courses&#x2014;they are all still in play today&#x2014;and shows that while Jones was admired in his own country, he was adored in Great Britain. But for all his international fame, Jones remained a true son of Atlanta, and The Immortal Bobby demonstrates how that fact affected his views on politics and race. The book also offers compelling new evidence that much of what has been widely believed about the spinal condition that made Jones's final years so tragic is incomplete and incorrect.</p><p>Capturing the story of this towering figure with a depth and richness never before achieved, The Immortal Bobby is a both a penetrating profile and a moving depiction of a long-gone sporting age.</p>RON RAPOPORT is an award-winning sports columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times and sports commentator for National Public Radio&#39;s Weekend Edition with Scott Simon.

In Bible Study That Works David Thompson outlines and demonstrates a method of Bible study which is consistent in its approach and not controlled by theological presuppositions. This method, often referred to as the &#34;Inductive Bible Study&#34; method, was developed and taught by Wilbert Webster White at The Biblical Seminary in New York. From there the method was transplanted to several other seminaries such as Princeton and Union (Virginia), and taught around the world by organizations such as InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. Bible Study That Works is the most readable and complete introduction to this method available today.</p><p>David L. Thompson is Professor of Biblical Studies at Asbury Theological Seminary. He has authored two other books including A Study Guide to Machem&#39;s New Testament Greek for Beginners.Dr. David Thompson is eminently qualified to lead the reader step by step into a life-changing study of God&#39;s Word. He has been a pastor as well as a teacher. He has dealt with people of varying backgrounds and abilities. He has been successful in leading people into the kind of &#34;Bible study that works.&#34; --Robert A.

Understanding assemblies as plural forms of performative action, Butler extends her theory of performativity to argue that precarity&#x2015;the destruction of the conditions of livability&#x2015;has been a galvanizing force and theme in today&#x2019;s highly visible protests.</p><p>Butler broadens the theory of performativity beyond speech acts to include the concerted actions of the body. Assemblies of physical bodies have an expressive dimension that cannot be reduced to speech, for the very fact of people gathering &#x201c;says&#x201d; something without always relying on speech. Drawing on Hannah Arendt&#x2019;s view of action, yet revising her claims about the role of the body in politics, Butler asserts that embodied ways of coming together, including forms of long-distance solidarity, imply a new understanding of the public space of appearance essential to politics.</p><p>Butler links assembly with precarity by pointing out that a body suffering under conditions of precarity still persists and resists, and that mobilization brings out this dual dimension of corporeal life. Just as assemblies make visible and audible the bodies that require basic freedoms of movement and association, so do they expose coercive practices in prison, the dismantling of social democracy, and the continuing demand for establishing subjugated lives as mattering, as equally worthy of life. By enacting a form of radical solidarity in opposition to political and economic forces, a new sense of &#x201c;the people&#x201d; emerges, interdependent, grievable, precarious, and persistent.</p></p><p>Judith Butler is Maxine Elliot Professor of Comparative Literature and Critical Theory at the University of California, Berkeley.&#x201c;[An] intellectual enquiry of public assembly politics...The book questions the role and aspects of public assembly, performative space and the performing body...While <i>Notes Toward A Performative Theory of Assembly</i> posits and comments upon a range of substantial material in a relatively compact space, the writing and ideas are far from impenetrable; rather, Butler writes in an uncomplicated manner about significant ideas. The book should be read by anyone interested in political science, human rights, social activism, critical theory, gender studies, socio-legal studies and philosophy, as well as those who themselves are part of contemporary movements.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Alexis Bushnell</b><b>, </b><b><i>LSE Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Butler&#x2019;s book is everything that a book about our planet in the 21st century should be. It does not turn its back on the circumstances of the material world or give any succour to those who wish to view the present (and the future) through the lens of fantasies about the transformative possibilities offered by conventional politics... Butler demonstrates a clear engagement with an aspect of the world that is becoming in many political contexts almost illicit to discuss: the idea that capitalism, certainly in its neoliberal form, is failing to provide a liveable life for the majority of human beings. The rhetorical question that Butler asks at the conclusion to her introduction&#x2015;of how we might act together when we live in worlds in which so many forms of solidarity are diminishing&#x2015;is a central question for politics throughout the world.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mary Evans</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Conceptually rich... Writing in response to the powerful wave of mass movements whose defining characteristic often involves people sitting or standing in the same place&#x2015;Gezi Park, Tahrir Square, Occupy, etc.&#x2015;Butler argues that freedom of assembly is an inextricable part of freedom of expression. And freedom of assembly is coming under increasing assault, in part because the very spaces in which people are assembling to voice their protest (which is often simply the demand for a decent life) are the ones under threat from capitalist regimes bent on privatizing public space, public goods and services, and on the violent enactment and enforcement of the private sphere... Like all of Butler&#x2019;s works, <i>Notes Toward a Performative Theory of Assembly</i> is a heady immersion into the thought of one of today&#x2019;s most profound philosophers of action... This is a call for a truly transformative politics, and its relevance to the fraught struggles taking place in today&#x2019;s streets and public spaces around the world cannot be denied. For those seeking a way to reconcile the waves of refugees, the alternating violence and silence of the streets, and the democratic ideals many of us have been raised to hold, Butler offers if not a way then the beginnings of a coherent way to think about it.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Hans Rollman</b><b>, </b><b><i>PopMatters</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;One of the boldest and most radical thinkers of our time, Butler examines the contemporary state of popular sovereignty, resistance, and other &#x2018;concerted actions,&#x2019; as Hannah Arendt termed them, of political engagement in this series of essays expanding on her theory of performativity. Looking at recent mass protests, including events in Tahrir Square and the various Occupy movements, she explores what freedom of assembly entails in different spaces&#x2015;public, private, confined, and virtual&#x2015;while focusing on how individuals can take actual, not simply rhetorical, political action... Butler&#x2019;s examination of popular sovereignty and public assembly is incisive and exigent.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Judith Butler has written a vital, timely, and moving book that shines new light on the collective dimension of dissent. Instead of upholding the false division between thought and action, she recognizes that radical ideas are necessarily embodied. All over the world people are rising up and saying no to police violence, racial and gender discrimination, ecological devastation, austerity, and precarity. This powerful book is for anyone who has ever assembled with others to demand a more just and equal future.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Astra Taylor, author of <i>The People&#x2019;s Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In effect, Butler has written a manifesto against the privatization and individuation of political cultures. Butler&#x2019;s elegant and detailed philosophical reflections engage seriously and deeply with the writing of Arendt and some of the debates around humanity and social and political ontology that her work has generated. This is a profound and brief but very ambitious book. It is challenging but not dense, as lucid as it is timely.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Paul Gilroy, author of <i>Darker than Blue: On the Moral Economies of Black Atlantic Culture</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Judith Butler wonderfully analyzes the power and promise of assembly, particularly the assembly of precarious populations, and in doing so offers a lucid and exciting analysis of contemporary forms of activism. This is a thinker at the height of her intellectual powers.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michael Hardt, co-author of <i>Commonwealth</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The book&#x2019;s novelty lies in its relatively substantive version of radical democracy.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>A. L. Shuster</b><b>, </b><b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A work that stands out as perhaps Butler&#x2019;s most concerted attempt to make sense of constructive human agency...<i>Notes Toward a Performative Theory of Assembly</i> is nonetheless Butler&#x2019;s most lucid and successful attempt to show that her views need not lead to &#x2018;quietism and retreat,&#x2019; and that they have always contained the seeds of a rich and important, positive contribution to political thought. Unlike some of her earlier works, this book is genuinely accessible to the intelligent student of political life who is not steeped in the abstruse and difficult claims of contemporary literary theory and cultural studies...Ultimately, Butler&#x2019;s project in <i>Notes Toward a Performative Theory</i> is valuable not only for its potential to rehabilitate humanism, but also for the clarity with which it requires the reader to recognize the political importance of contemporary media&#x2015;perhaps especially social media&#x2015;for the ways they have altered ethical and political domains.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michele M.

After participating in the a.d. 43 invasion of Britain, the 14th Legion achieved its greatest glory when it put down the famous rebellion of the Britons under Boudicca. Numbering less than 10,000 men, the disciplined Roman killing machine defeated 230,000 rampaging rebels, slaughtering 80,000 with only 400 Roman losses�&#x20ac;&#x201c;an accomplishment that led the emperor Nero to honor the legion with the title "Conqueror of Britain."

Numbering less than 10,000 men, the disciplined Roman soldiers defeated 230,000 rampaging British rebels, slaughtering 80,000 while incurring only 400 losses&#x2014;an accomplishment that led the emperor Nero to honor the legion with the title "Conqueror of Britain." </p><p>In this gripping book, second in the author's definitive histories of the legions of ancient Rome, Stephen Dando-Collins brings the 14th Legion to life, offering a unique soldier's-eye view of their tactics, campaigns, and battles and exploring the gruesome realities of war in the Classical Age. Based on his thirty-two years of painstaking research into the Roman military, Nero's Killing Machine paints a striking portrait of daily life in the legion as it traces its storied history&#x2014;beginning with the disastrous day in 54 B.C. when, led into a trap while serving under Julius Caesar, the legion was wiped from the face of the earth.</p><p>You'll see how, for decades, the legion struggled to regain its lost status, treading a blood-soaked path and slowly climbing back to glory by fighting first under Germanicus Caesar against Hermann the German, then under Gaius Suetonius Paulinus against Queen Boudicca&#x2014;vastly outnumbered but determined to preserve honor if not life as it went down fighting. You'll also gain new insights into the lives of the legionnaires&#x2014;men who, hardened by years of rigorous training and rigid Roman military discipline enforced by often brutal centurions, merged into a close-knit, chillingly efficient killing machine.</p><p>Filled with previously unknown details about Roman military practices, Nero's Killing Machine is a riveting, eye-opening history of the men who made Rome great.</p><p>The glorious saga of the most celebrated legion of the early Roman Empire</p><p>In Nero's Killing Machine, the second in the author's definitive histories of the legions of ancient Rome, Stephen Dando-Collins brings the 14th Legion to vivid life. Drawing upon thirty-two years of research, he traces the legion's steps as they were wiped out while in the army of Julius Caesar, then reformed only to be savaged again. For decades the men of the 14th would struggle to regain their lost status, slowly climbing back to glory and eventually making a legendary stand against Britain's Queen Boudicca, vastly outnumbered but determined to go down fighting with honor. Uncovering new information about the legionnaires' lives and Roman military practices, Nero's Killing Machine is military history at its finest.</p><p>Praise for Caesar's Legion</p><p>"A unique and splendidly researched story, following the trials and triumphs of Julius Caesar's Legio X&#x2014;arguably the most famous legion of its day&#x2014;from its activation to the slogging battle of Munda and from Thapsus, Caesar's tactical masterpiece, to the grim siege of the Jewish fortress of Masada. More than a mere unit account, it incorporates the history of Rome and the Roman army at the height of their power and gory glory. Many military historians consider Caesar's legions the world's most efficient infantry before the arrival of gunpowder. This book shows why. Written in readable, popular style, Caesar's Legion is a must for military buffs and anyone interested in Roman history at a critical point in European civilization."<br>&#x2014;T. R.

King and Leslie S. Klinger, with stories of Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, and friends in a variety of eras and forms. King and Klinger have a simple formula: ask some of the world&#x2019;s greatest writers&#x2015;regardless of genre&#x2015;to be inspired by the stories of Arthur Conan Doyle.</p><p>The results are surprising and joyous. Some tales are pastiches, featuring the recognizable figures of Holmes and Watson; others step away in time or place to describe characters and stories influenced by the Holmes world. Some of the authors spin whimsical tales of fancy; others tell hard-core thrillers or puzzling mysteries. One beloved author writes a song; two others craft a melancholy graphic tale of insectoid analysis.</p><p>This is not a volume for readers who crave a steady diet of stories about Holmes and Watson on Baker Street. Rather, it is for the generations of readers who were themselves inspired by the classic tales, and who are prepared to let their imaginations roam freely.</p><p>Featuring Stories by:&nbsp;Peter S. Beagle, Rhys Bowen, Reed Farrel Coleman, Jamie Freveletti, Alan Gordon, Gregg Hurwitz, Toni L. P. Kelner, William Kotzwinkle and Joe Servello, Harley Jane Kozak, D. P. Lyle, Weston Ochse, Zoe Sharp, Duane Swierczynski, and F. Paul Wilson.</p></p><p><p><strong>Laurie R. King</strong> is the <em>New York Times&nbsp;</em>bestselling author of numerous books, including the Mary Russell-Sherlock Holmes stories. She has won or been nominated for a multitude of prizes, has been chosen as the guest of honor at several crime conventions, and is probably the only writer to have both an Edgar Award and an honorary doctorate in theology. She was inducted into the Baker Street Irregulars in 2010.</p><p><strong>Leslie S. Klinger</strong>&nbsp;is one of the world&#x2019;s foremost authorities on Sherlock Holmes. He is the editor of the three-volume&nbsp;<em>The New Annotated Sherlock&nbsp;Holmes</em>.&nbsp;The first two volumes,<em>&nbsp;The Complete Short Stories</em>,&nbsp;won the Edgar for &#x201c;Best Critical/Biographical&#x201d; work. He is also the editor of the hugely&nbsp;successful&nbsp;<em>The New&nbsp;Annotated H. P. Lovecraft</em>.&nbsp;Klinger is a member of the Baker Street Irregulars and lives in Malibu, California.</p>This energetic and offbeat anthology of Sherlock Holmes-inspired works charmingly leans into 21st-century fandom. The 14 unique entries include cozy and noir mysteries, with the occasional speculative twist, and a short graphic novel and a song. Teens familiar with the surplus of Holmes online fan fiction will especially enjoy seeing the figure reinvented as the insect "Inspector Mantis" in a comic by William Kotzwinkle and Joe Servello, as well as the multitude of Holmes cosplayers in Toni L.P. Kelner's "The Adventure of the Six Sherlocks." Rhys Bowen's "Sherlocked," featuring a robot Holmes that resembles a vacuum cleaner, is another quirky standout. This is the third in a series curated by King and Klinger; one hopes the next volume will focus even more on the weirder and more speculative tales that are particular highlights here. VERDICT A strong optional purchase for YA collections for libraries with teen patrons already familiar with the Sherlockian fandom.-Ann Foster, Saskatoon Public Library, Sask.&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Originally from Memphis, Dickey now lives on the road and rests in whatever hotel will have him.<p></p><p>6:31 P.M.</p><p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and then sirens interrupted my unlawful transaction. Law enforcement sped in our direction. I winced, cursed, and shivered. The Hawaiian Gardens Police Department and the sheriff&#x2019;s department were coming to arrest me. The abruptness of the sound of so many sirens caused my body to shake, caused adrenaline to rush, triggered my fight-or-flight mode. The prolonged scream of sirens became louder. Came closer.</p><p>The darkness that had arrived long before five o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon deepened as a perpetual winter rain, cold as ice cubes, intensified the misery on this frigid, colorless night.</p><p>I turned and confronted the man in the expensive gray suit. He was tense, twitching as if he had also experienced the sudden heat that comes from fear, from fight-or-flight, but a man dressed like he was would never have anything to run from. He looked like he knew the cops were coming here.</p><p>I snapped, &#x201c;Are you with the police? <i>Are you a friggin&#x2019; cop?</i>&#x201d;</p><p>Winter rain was being spat from the miserable skies, traffic was bumper to bumper; there was no way I could get to the truck that fast, nowhere to run, and the sirens called my name as they sped closer.</p><p>Closer.</p><p>The truck. They were coming for me because of the goddamn truck.</p><p>Brow furrowed, the well-dressed man made fists and turned toward the incessant wails.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t ready for this. I didn&#x2019;t have an exit plan, not under these conditions.</p><p>A winter storm had been going since morning and had caused at least six hundred traffic accidents in three hours; at least five of those were within spitting distance. Traffic was a bitch with PMS, and all the diehards were out Christmas shopping. Cars, SUVs, pickup trucks, minivans, and hearses clogged the entrance to the Long Beach Towne Center, Hawaiian Gardens Casino, and every strip mall that made up this waterlogged city. That made it impossible for me to get back in my ride and speed away. And if I did manage to get to the truck, the world before me crept toward the 605 at three miles per hour, and traffic heading in the opposite direction on Carson Boulevard couldn&#x2019;t be breaking five.</p><p>And as the sirens sang, my frustration was like a slow ride to hell in a flooding dystopia.</p><p>Closer. Closer.</p><p>He remained tense, his jaw tight, not blinking, his body language speaking of nothing but trouble.</p><p>This was unexpected. Fear arrested me. I almost let my weapon slide down to my hand.</p><p>Closer. Closer. Closer.</p><p>Patrol cars sped by with their fiery lights flashing, raced toward Lakewood, toward Long Beach. We were underneath the shelter between two gas pumps. Behind us was a nonstop line of traffic, a line that stretched both in the direction of the 605 freeway and deeper into Hawaiian Gardens.</p><p>The man in the suit took a hard breath, opened and closed his right hand, his face thunderous</p><p>Voice trembling, feeling my fear, I asked, &#x201c;Now, where were we?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You parked your truck and came to me with an interesting proposition.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can let the MacBook Pro I have go for seven hundred. Cash.&#x201d;</p><p>He said, &#x201c;Really? Seven hundred dollars for a stolen MacBook Pro?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Once again, it&#x2019;s the fifteen-inch, and this sells at the Apple Store for over two thousand dollars. If you get it for seven hundred, you&#x2019;ve saved at least thirteen hundred.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t save money by spending money.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;ll never be on a billboard on Sunset Boulevard. Saving is bad for the economy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really? You&#x2019;re expecting to get that much for a stolen computer that has no warranty?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, how much are you willing to give me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One hundred dollars.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dude, you&#x2019;re crazy. This has the latest-generation Intel processors, all-new graphics, faster flash storage, and retina display. This bad boy has over five million pixels. That&#x2019;s better than HDTV. The battery lasts up to eight hours. Don&#x2019;t tell me you&#x2019;re a PC guy? You look too hip to be a PC guy.&#x201d;</p><p>His left eye was bruised. Maybe he had been mugged, or involved in a Christmas brawl. Customers throw hard blows for two-dollar holiday sales at Walmart, and there was one up the street, its lot packed&#x2014;but his suit and car were made for Rodeo Drive. He considered something beyond me, glanced at the battered old white Nissan truck I was driving.</p><p>He said, &#x201c;Best Buy sent you to do deliveries in that truck?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I had to drive my own vehicle tonight. Company cutbacks.&#x201d;</p><p>A few minutes earlier I had driven from my resting spot by the Towne Center and the Edwards Cinema into a Chevron station. There were seventeen gas pumps, all but three occupied, and the twenty-four-hour Subway attached to the gas station was just as busy. I had pulled up to pump number 17, stopping opposite pump number 12 and a brother in a modern gray suit. When I eased out of the truck, he was holding his gas hose, his shoulders hunched like he&#x2019;d never been rained on in his life. I put on a cheerleader smile, walked halfway to him&#x2014;bouncy and perky like Katie Couric&#x2014;told him that his whip was very nice&#x2014;used that praise as an opener&#x2014;then engaged him with a flirty smile and started a conversation. I eased closer, whispered that I had a MacBook to sell, asked him if he might be interested in a deal. He had paused, inspected me. My wig was long and loose, like a bad-hair day, and I wore a stolen yellow polo shirt and Dockers that had come at the same five-finger discount, both too big, and a stolen Best Buy badge on my jean jacket. He stepped closer and asked me to repeat what I had said. I told him I had a new laptop in the truck, asked him if he wanted to buy it before I sold it to someone else. I told him the price. Then sirens had echoed and passed. Now we were back to haggling in the rain.</p><p>He evaluated me from shoes to eyes and asked, &#x201c;Are you Egyptian?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Am I Egyptian? Are we in Egypt?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You look Egyptian.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m part broke and part black, all mixed with hard times and frustration.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked down his nose at my uniform, my face. &#x201c;Your tongue is pierced.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. So what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you do at Best Buy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not important. You want to buy the MacBook or not?&#x201d;</p><p>A frigid breeze kicked in and chilled his condescending attitude.</p><p>His phone buzzed. He held it up, read a message, then scowled at the traffic.</p><p>I asked, &#x201c;Need to go so soon?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A long text message from my wife.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You okay? Look like you just received bad news.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s just arrived at a hospital.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is she okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Distraught. Family friend had an accident. Someone close to both our families.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you need to go to her?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a doctor. Nothing I can do but watch her break down and cry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Need to text her back?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s type-A, not a woman that many men can date, let alone marry, because she is always stressed out. She will have a fit if I don&#x2019;t respond right away. For her, everything&#x2019;s urgent. So I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Type-A. She&#x2019;s the type of person who loves to win at everything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know how she is, and you&#x2019;re going to leave her anxious. That&#x2019;s cold.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cold like winter in Siberia.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So do you want the computer or not? You&#x2019;re making me miss out on other customers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me again, how did you manage to get a brand-new MacBook Pro?&#x201d;</p><p>I turned up my jacket collar, shivered, shifted from one hard-toe shoe to the other, and told him I worked the stockroom over in Hawthorne, just east of the 405. It was a rainy Wednesday night and I had been sent on deliveries. Despite Amazon running the world, I told him, Best Buy still did drop-offs.</p><p>The man in the gray suit asked, &#x201c;How&#x2019;d you manage to come across that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that laptop?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Told you. They had an extra one. I went over the electronic invoice and it wasn&#x2019;t listed. So it fell into a black hole. I never signed for this one. It won&#x2019;t be reported. It will simply vanish from the database. My dilemma is trying to decide if I am going to take it back and get somebody in trouble for the screwup, or see this as a sign and sell it and make enough money to pay my rent this month.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re short on your rent.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Most of my income goes to paying frickin&#x2019; rent. Like everybody else in L.A., I&#x2019;m always short.&#x201d;</p><p>I had said too much. That admission gave him bargaining power.</p><p>Another police car zoomed by, forced angry people to pull to the right, made a bad traffic evening a lot more frustrating. The siren was so loud I had to wait for the downside of the noise to go on talking.</p><p>He asked, &#x201c;How much is your rent?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dude, it&#x2019;s cold out here, and it&#x2019;s raining. Half the people in L.A. are coughing and the other half have the flu. So before I end up getting sick as a dog, do you want to buy the MacBook Pro or not?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Might be a way that I could help you out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m only bargaining with the laptop. Nothing else is for sale.&#x201d;</p><p>He said, &#x201c;Three hundred. Take it or leave it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Six. That&#x2019;s my bottom line.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you better take that stolen computer to eBay.&#x201d;</p><p>I was about to curse him, but he pulled his wallet out and let me see a fresh row of greenbacks inside. Couldn&#x2019;t remember when I&#x2019;d had that much cash and it wasn&#x2019;t being used to pay a bill.</p><p>I said, &#x201c;You can afford the six. This laptop cost over two grand. Don&#x2019;t rip me off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I could afford to go the Apple Store and buy one brand-new with a full warranty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do better than three hundred. Three hundred is below Black Friday prices.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a pretty woman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m almost as pretty as that silver wedding ring on your left hand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re wearing a pretty nice ring as well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On my right hand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why is it on your right hand?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because it won&#x2019;t fit on the middle finger of my left hand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But that is a wedding righty, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your ring is on your left hand. That means you bought the cow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yours on the right hand means?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It means I&#x2019;m no one&#x2019;s cow. So where&#x2019;s your cow? Where&#x2019;s the woman you make go moo?&#x201d;</p><p>He said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re estranged. I guess that would be the best way to put it at the moment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At the moment? What, you&#x2019;re estranged until you get home? Then you make her go moo?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a long day for me; a long day with lots of driving and lots of stress, and anger, and too much drama. This traffic is starting to look like they&#x2019;re evacuating Los Angeles. We&#x2019;re both going to be trapped in this dull city. Let&#x2019;s go somewhere warm and dry and grab a bite to eat and talk about it.&#x201d;</p><p>I said, &#x201c;Buy your wife this laptop, maybe stop by 7-Eleven and pick up a hot dog, find her some crotchless lingerie at the ninety-nine-cent store, go to redtube.com and look at some hot porn by Belle Knox or Lisa Ann, role-play, and I guarantee you that by tomorrow evening you two will be tight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mind if I take a look at the merchandise first?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s hot off the press and still factory-sealed. So, yeah, I mind the box being opened.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mind if I check out the five million pixels and retina display that&#x2019;s better than HDTV?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in a rush. You can open the box when you get home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t do it now? I can&#x2019;t open what you&#x2019;re selling me from Best Buy now?&#x201d;</p><p>His tone darkened, sent a chill up my spine.</p><p>He repeated, &#x201c;Open the box. Let me turn the computer on.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>6:36 P.M.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t back down. &#x201c;Open your wallet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Show me what you&#x2019;re selling.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Show me the money.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see the laptop that Best Buy lost in the system.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not opening the box for you until I have the money in my hand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two thousand. I&#x2019;ll give you top dollar for a stolen laptop.&#x201d;</p><p>I paused, nose wanting to run, shivering, hunger pangs gripping my belly. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the catch?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If I open that box and there is actually a laptop in there, a brand-new MacBook Pro, and it has the paperwork, and it turns on, you get the two grand. If it doesn&#x2019;t power up, or if you&#x2019;re trying to do a version of the old rocks-in-a-box scam, then it&#x2019;s a new game. So, who&#x2019;s zooming who here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nobody is trying to run game.&#x201d;</p><p>He said, &#x201c;But if it&#x2019;s not a laptop, two hundred for a blow job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re disgusting. And someone married your ass?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re leaving? I thought we had a transaction going on here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have a good life, and tell the cow you make go moo I send my sympathies.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hold up.&#x201d;</p><p>I said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t come any closer.&#x201d;</p><p>He put his hand on my jacket. I thought he was attacking me, but he just stuck something in my jacket pocket. His hand felt my breast when he did it. I went ballistic.</p><p>I snapped, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t touch me. I don&#x2019;t friggin&#x2019; know you like that.&#x201d;</p><p>I allowed what I had in my jacket sleeve to slide down to my hand.

But the meeting at Bretton Woods in 1944 was different. It was the only time countries from around the world have agreed to overhaul the structure of the international monetary system. Against all odds, they were successful. The system they set up presided over the longest, strongest and most stable period of growth the world economy has ever seen. Its demise some decades later was at least partly responsible for the periodic economic crises that culminated in the financial collapse of the 2000s.<br><br> But what everyone has always assumed to be a dry economic conference was in fact replete with drama. The delegates spent half the time at each other's throats and the other half drinking in the hotel bar. The Russians nearly capsized the entire project. The French threatened to walk out, repeatedly. All the while war in Europe raged on.<br><br> At the very heart of the conference was the love-hate relationship between the Briton John Maynard Keynes, the greatest economist of his day, who suffered a heart attack at the conference itself and who was a true worldwide celebrity - and his American counterpart Harry Dexter White (later revealed to be passing information secretly to Russian spies). Both were intent on creating an economic settlement which would put right the wrongs of Versailles. Both were working to prevent another world war. But they were also working to defend their countries' national interests.<br><br> Drawing on a wealth of unpublished accounts, diaries and oral histories, this brilliant book describes the conference in stunning color and clarity. Bringing to life the characters, events and economics and written with exceptional verve and narrative pace, this is an extraordinary debut from a talented new historian. 16 pages of B&amp;W photographs</p><p>Ed Conway is the economics editor of Sky News. Previously he was the economics editor of the&nbsp;Daily Telegraph&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Sunday Telegraph. His appointment to this role, when only twenty-five, made him the youngest ever economics editor of a British national newspaper. He lives in London.&#x201c;A gripping story for both general readers and scholars interested in World War II, the Cold War, and domestic and international political economy. The author knows how to write for those who are less informed about economics while telling the history of the turbulent conference through its leading characters and updating its legacy today. An essential purchase on this topic.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In his gripping account of an exhausting three weeks in 1944, during which the IMF and the World Bank came into being, Ed Conway tells how the participants set out to rid the global economy of the types of dangerous imbalances that lie at the root of the eurozone&#x2019;s current predicament.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Financial Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Bretton Woods was a response to a problem that bedeviled international markets in the 1930s and bedevils them today.

A sweeping account.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The New York Times Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;With no false modesty, Conway calls [Bretton Woods] &#x2018;a gripping tale,&#x2019; and he is right on target. A lively writer, he keeps the reader fully engaged from start to finish: everything you could wish for about Bretton Woods and its aftermath. Mr. Conway is as sound in his judgments as his scope is wide and his analyses probing.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Washington Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Brimming with the sort of vivid details that make the past come alive, <em>The Summit</em> is both an impressive work of scholarship and an absolute delight to read.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Liaquat Ahamed, author of Lords of Finance</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Excellent. Conway superbly describes the political rivalries. Entertaining and informative, Conway&#x2019;s book mixes high partying with big thinking about serious matters.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>BBC History Magazine</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A compelling portrait of the event, which took place on the international stage of big-power geopolitics and was driven by long-range changes in monetary relations. The scope of the subject matter is impressive, and the execution is outstanding.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Stellar. <em>The Summit</em> manages to be a near-perfect blend of complexity and readability. Using an unprecedented number and variety of primary sources (many of which have never been mined before, making this quite the best book on the subject), Conway tells a tangled story of personalities and policy minutiae at a conference whose seismic after-effects are still being felt today, and Conway is every bit as masterful in detailing those after-effects as he is at telling the main story.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Open Letters Monthly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A lively history.

He challenged Americans to shut their ears against Europe&#x2019;s &#x201c;courtly muses&#x201d; and to forge a new, distinctly American cultural identity. But he remains one of America&#x2019;s least understood writers. And, by his own admission, he spawned neither school nor follower (he valued independent thought too much). Now, in this annotated selection of Emerson&#x2019;s writings, David Mikics instructs the reader in a larger appreciation of Emerson&#x2019;s essential works and the remarkable thinker who produced them.</p><p>Full of color illustrations and rich in archival photographs, this volume offers much for the specialist and general reader. In his running commentaries on Emerson&#x2019;s essays, addresses, and poems, Mikics illuminates contexts, allusions, and language likely to cause difficulty to modern readers. He quotes extensively from Emerson&#x2019;s <i>Journal</i> to shed light on particular passages or lines and examines Emerson the essayist, poet, itinerant lecturer, and political activist. Finally, in his Foreword, Phillip Lopate makes the case for Emerson as a spectacular truth teller&#x2015;a model of intellectual labor and anti-dogmatic sanity.</p><p>Anyone who values Emerson will want to own this edition. Those wishing to discover, or to reacquaint themselves with, Emerson&#x2019;s writings but who have not known where or how to begin will not find a better starting place or more reliable guide than <i>The Annotated Emerson</i>.</p></p><p>David Mikics is John and Rebecca Moores Professor of English at the University of Houston.&#x201c;Mikics's annotations are gracious, helpful, and genuinely illuminating.

This is in no way Emerson lite. These are not shortcuts but rather a welcome frame for Emerson's particular kind of difficulty. The book's introductions curate the voluminous career, and the wide margins of the pages, dappled with thoughtful notes, give the meditations space to unfurl. This is a book that gives us each hope to approach the "new yet unapproachable" Emerson. Any lay reader will find an open door here. Those who already love Emerson and know him well may find a few cherished things missing, but they may also find a few things they didn't know they wanted to find.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Tess Gallagher</b><b>, </b><b><i>Barnes &amp; Noble Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Editor Mikics has selected the best known of Emerson's works but also includes excerpts from his journals, selections from lesser-read books, and a number of his poems.

The Annotated Emerson, edited by David Mikics, an English professor at the University of Houston, explains language and allusions that may be foreign to today's readers. By doing this, Mikics makes a great American essayist, whom Phillip Lopate in his foreword calls a "hero of intellectual labor," readily accessible to a new generation.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jan Gardner</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Copiously annotated, richly illustrated and handsomely bound, a volume all lovers not just of literature but of freedom will want on their shelves...[Emerson's] astute observations and generous vision of the world within and without still have much to teach.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William Yeoman</b><b>, </b><b><i>West Australian</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Mikics has put together a handsome edition of Emerson's most popular and enduring work. First-time readers of Emerson will find the collection useful because the annotations reference the common occurrences of Emerson's attention and, along with the illustrations, place Emerson's work in the context of the 19th century.

Trading in his gold-trimmed jacket for standard-issue fatigues, Elvis became a model soldier in an army facing the unprecedented challenge of building a fighting force for the Atomic Age.</p><p>In an era that threatened Soviet-American thermonuclear annihilation, the army declared it could limit atomic warfare to the battlefield. It not only adopted a radically new way of fighting but also revamped its equipment, organization, concepts, and training practices. From massive garrisons in Germany and Korea to nuclear tests to portable atomic weapons, the army reinvented itself. Its revolution in warfare required an equal revolution in personnel: the new army needed young officers and soldiers who were highly motivated, well trained, and technologically adept. Drafting Elvis demonstrated that even this icon of youth culture was not too cool to wear the army&#x2019;s uniform.</p><p>The army of the 1950s was America&#x2019;s most racially and economically egalitarian institution, providing millions with education, technical skills, athletics, and other opportunities. With the cooperation of both the army and the media, military service became a common theme in television, music, and movies, and part of this generation&#x2019;s identity. Brian Linn traces the origins, evolution, and ultimate failure of the army&#x2019;s attempt to transform itself for atomic warfare, revealing not only the army&#x2019;s vital role in creating Cold War America but also the experiences of its forgotten soldiers.</p></p><p>Brian McAllister Linn is Professor of History at Texas A&amp;M University.&#x201c;Brian Linn&#x2019;s history holds lessons for us: be wary about claims of revolutionary change in warfare; find ways to keep servicemen and women connected to those in whose name they serve; recognize that the American military&#x2019;s advantage over potential enemies is more human than technological.

[Linn&#x2019;s] argument is bolstered by data from internal Army studies and the quoted recollections of those who&#x2015;whether as generals, privates, or something in between&#x2015;lived through the era and witnessed it from the inside. The sheer volume of material Linn marshals in support of his case is staggering, and the artfulness with which he wrangles it into thematic chapters on subjects such as doctrine, weapons, recruitment, training, and public relations is impressive. The book is dense with facts and examples, but Linn&#x2019;s smooth, fluid prose means that it never feels like a slog. Quite the opposite: Anyone with a serious interest in one of Linn&#x2019;s central themes&#x2015;American military culture, the Cold War, or innovation&#x2015;is likely to find <i>Elvis&#x2019;s Army</i> compulsively readable.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>A.

Francesca Bray, working closely with Dr Needham, has produced the most comprehensive study of Chinese agriculture to be published in the West. From a huge mass of source material, often confusing and obscure, and from first-hand study in China, she brings order and illumination to a crucial area of Chinese technological development. The main body of the book is an account of the technological history of agriculture, with major sections devoted to field systems, implements and techniques (sowing, harvesting, storing) and crop systems (what has grown and where and how crops rotated). The concluding section contrasts Europe&#39;s Agricultural Revolution with agrarian change in North China in the Han and with the &#39;Green Revolution&#39; in South China in the Sung. In the theoretical analysis which concludes this section we find a vital contribution to the elucidation of the main question posed by Dr Needham&#39;s work: why did the Scientific Revolution which transformed the world take place in Europe and not in China?</p><p>This second part of the sixth volume of Joeph Needham&#39;s great enterprise is an account of the technological history of agriculture, with major sections devoted to field systems, implements and techniques (sowing, harvesting, storing) and crop systems (what has grown and where and how crops rotated)."[An] astonishing and enduring study...[Needham brings] depth of emotion and technical finesse to his task."<br> Jonathan Spence, New York Review of Books<br><br>"Perhaps the greatest single act of historical synthesis and intercultural communication ever attempted by one man."<br> Laurence Picken, Cambridge University</p><h2>Frontinus: Stratagems. Aqueducts of Rome. (Loeb Classical Library No. 174)</h2><p><p>Frontinus, Sextus Iulius, ca. 35&#x2013;103 CE, was a capable Roman civil officer and military commander. Praetor of the city in 70 and consul in 73 or 74, 98 and 100, he was, about the year 76, sent to Britain as governor. He quelled the Silures of Wales, and began to build a road through their territory; his place was taken by Agricola in 78. In 97 he was given the highly esteemed office of Manager of Aqueducts at Rome. He is known to have been an augur, being succeeded by his friend Pliny the younger.</p><p>The two sides of Frontinus's public career are reflected in his two surviving works. 'Strategemata', <i>Stratagems,</i> written after 84, gives examples of military stratagems from Greek and Roman history, for the instruction of Roman officers, in three books; the fourth book is concerned largely with military discipline. 'De Aquis urbis Romae', <i>The Aqueducts of Rome,</i> written in 97&#x2013;98, gives some historical details and a description of the aqueducts for the water supply of the city, with laws relating to them. Frontinus aimed at being useful and writes in a rather popular style which is both simple and clear.</p></p><p><p>Charles Edwin Bennett (1858&#x2013;1921) was Goldwin Smith Professor of Latin at Cornell University.</p>Text: Latin, English (translation)</p><h2>George Washington Carver: A Life (Southern Biography Series)</h2><p><p>Nearly every American can cite at least one of the accomplishments of George Washington Carver. The many tributes honoring his contributions to scientific advancement and black history include a national monument bearing his name, a U.S.-minted coin featuring his likeness, and induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. Born into slavery, Carver earned a master's degree at Iowa State Agricultural College and went on to become that university's first black faculty member. A keen painter who chose agricultural studies over art, he focused the majority of his research on peanuts and sweet potatoes. His scientific breakthroughs with the crops -- both of which would replenish the cotton-leached soil of the South -- helped spare multitudes of sharecroppers from poverty. Despite Carver's lifelong difficulties with systemic racial prejudice, when he died in 1943, millions of Americans mourned the passing of one of the nation's most honored and well-known scientists. Scores of children's books celebrate the contributions of this prolific botanist, but no biographer has fully examined both his personal life and career until now.<br>Christina Vella offers a thorough biography of George Washington Carver, including in-depth details of his relationships with his friends, colleagues, supporters, and those he loved. Despite the exceptional trajectory of his career, Carver was not immune to the racism of the Jim Crow era or the privations and hardships of the Great Depression and two world wars. Yet throughout this tumultuous period, his scientific achievements aligned him with equally extraordinary friends, including Teddy Roosevelt, Mohandas Gandhi, Henry A. Wallace, and Henry Ford.<br>In pursuit of the man behind the historical figure, Vella discovers an unassuming intellectual with a quirky sense of humor, striking eccentricities, and an unwavering religious faith. She explores Carver's anguished dealings with Booker T. Washington across their nineteen years working together at the Tuskegee Institute -- a turbulent partnership often fraught with jealousy. Uneasy in personal relationships, Carver lost one woman he loved to suicide and, years later, directed his devotion toward a white man.<br>A prodigious and generous scholar whose life was shaped by struggle and heartbreak as well as success and fame, George Washington Carver remains a key figure in the history of southern agriculture, botanical advancement, and the struggle for civil rights. Vella's extensively researched biography offers a complex and compelling portrait of one of the most brilliant men of the last century.</p></p><p><p>Christina Vella received a PhD in modern European and U.S. history from Tulane University, where she is a Visiting Professor. A consultant for the U.S. State Department, she lectures widely on historical and biographical topics.</p>''Vella presents a portrait of a sensitive man who rose above the racial restrictions of the time. . . . An extraordinary look at the life of a brilliant man.'' --<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)<br><br>''The challenges of writing the life of this enigmatic genius--black, bisexual, protean--are perennial and well-known. In this timely book Christina Vella's solutions are resourceful--and in crucial chapters--ingenious. She writes with brio and wit, never losing the thread of a narrative that is urgent, dramatic, and vital American history.'' --Daniel Mark Epstein, author of <i>The Lincolns: Portrait of a Marriage</i></p><h2>Welding</h2><p><p>Drawing on 50+ years of combined instructional experience, the authors of <i> <b> <i>Welding </i> </b> </i>fuse simplicity and technology to deliver exactly what today&#x2019;s students need.

Drawing on extensive original research, Sheila Fitzpatrick provides the first in-depth account of this inner circle and their families. She vividly describes how these dedicated comrades-in-arms not only worked closely with Stalin, but also constituted his social circle. Stalin's team included the wily security chief Beria; Andreev, who traveled to provincial purges while listening to Beethoven on a portable gramophone; and Khrushchev, who finally disbanded the team four years after Stalin's death. Taking readers from the cataclysms of the Great Purges and World War II to the paranoia of Stalin's final years, <i>On Stalin's Team</i> paints an entirely new picture of Stalin within his milieu&#x2015;one that transforms our understanding of how the Soviet Union was ruled during much of its existence.</p></p><p><p>"<i>On Stalin's Team</i> is an utterly absorbing and sometimes blood-curdling account of the domestic and office life of the most bourgeois of proletarian dictators.

His unusual combination of academic interests led him toward a Master of Arts in mathematics from the University of Miami and a doctorate in behavioral sciences fro Nova University. Bob is most energized by teaching mathematics and has taught a variety of mathematics courses at Miami-Dade College for nearly 30 years. He has received numerous teaching awards, including Innovator of the Year from the League for Innovations in the Community College, and was among the first group of recipients at Miami-Dade College for an endowed chair based on excellence in the classroom. Bob has written <i>Intermediate Algebra for College Students, Introductory Algebra for College Students, Essentials of Intermediate Algebra for College Students, Introductory and Intermediate Algebra for College Students, Essentials of Introductory and Intermediate Algebra for College Students, Algebra for College Students, Thinking Mathematically, College Algebra, Algebra and Trigonometry</i>, and <i>Precalculus</i>, all published by Prentice Hall.<p><b>Preface</b></p> <p> Today's college algebra and trigonometry students are a diverse group. Some are going on into calculus or other math sequences, whereas others will complete their math requirements with this course. This text is designed and written to help both sets of students succeed. The book has three fundamental goals: First, to help students acquire a solid foundation in algebra and trigonometry, preparing them for other college courses such as calculus, business calculus, finite mathematics, and computer science; second, to show students how algebra and trigonometry can model and solve authentic real-world problems; and third, to enable students to develop problem-solving skills, fostering critical thinking within a varied and interesting setting. </p> <p> A source of frustration for me and my colleagues is that very few students read their textbook. When I ask students why they do not take full advantage of the text, their responses generally fall into two categories: </p> <ul> <li>"I cannot follow the explanations."</li> <li>"The applications are not interesting."</li> </ul> <p> I thought about both of these objections in writing every page of this book. </p> <p> <b>"I can't follow the explanations."</b> For many of my students, textbook explanations are too compressed. The chapters in <i>Algebra &amp; Trigonometry</i> have been written to make them extremely accessible. Every section contains a range of simple, intermediate, and challenging examples. Voice balloons allow for specific annotations in examples, further clarifying procedures and concepts. </p> <p> <b>"The applications are not interesting."</b> One of the things I enjoy most about teaching in a large urban community college is the diversity of who my students are and what interests them. Real-world data that celebrate this variety are used to bring relevance to examples, discussions, and applications. I selected all updated real-world data to be interesting and intriguing to students. By connecting algebra and trigonometry to the whole spectrum of their interests, it is my intent to show students that their world is profoundly mathematical and, indeed, pi is in the sky. </p> <p><b>Student Supplements</b></p> <p> <b>Student Solutions Manual (0-13-089785-X); (8978E-0).</b> Includes fully worker out solutions to most of the odd-numbered exercises in the text as well as all exercises in chapter tests and all review exercises. </p> <p> <b>MathPak Integrated Learning Environment (0-13-089384-6); (8938D-2).</b> Contains the College Algebra MathPro 4.0 along with a passcode-protected Website specifically designed to accompany this text.

In <i>Of Time and Lamentation</i>, Raymond Tallis rises to this challenge and explores the nature and meaning of time and how best to understand it. The culmination of some twenty years of thinking, writing, and wondering about (and within) time, it is a bold, original, and thought-provoking work. With characteristic fearlessness, Tallis seeks to reclaim time from the jaws of physics.<br><br>For most of us, time is composed of mornings, afternoons, and evenings and expressed in hurry, hope, longing, waiting, enduring, planning, joyful expectation, and grief. Thinking about it is to meditate on our own mortality. Yet, physics has little or nothing to say about this time, the time as it is lived. The story told by caesium clocks, quantum theory, and Lorentz coordinates, Tallis argues, needs to be supplemented by one of moss on rocks, tears on faces, and the long narratives of our human journey. Our temporal lives deserve a richer attention than is afforded by the equations of mathematical physics.<br><br>For anyone who has puzzled over the nature of becoming, wondered whether time is inseparable from change, whether time is punctuate or continuous, or even whether time itself is real, <i>Of Time and Lamentation</i> will provoke and entertain. Those, like Tallis himself, who seek to find a place at which the scientific and humanistic views of humanity can be reconciled, will celebrate his placing of human consciousness at the heart of time, and his showing that we are &#x201c;more than cogs in the universal clock, forced to collaborate with the very progress that pushes us towards our own midnight.&#x201d;</p><p>Raymond Tallis was professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Manchester and was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences for his research in clinical neuroscience. He retired from medicine in 2006 to become a full-time writer. <i>The Economist</i> lists him as one of the world's leading polymaths.There is hardly a thinking person who has not been struck, at some stage in life, by the deep mystery of time. How is it that things come into being and then pass away? What is a moment, and what flows as the moments succeed each other? What is it to exist <i>in</i> time, and is time another dimension, like the three dimensions of space? Can time be recaptured, replayed, or is all time unredeemable? Does time as described by the theory of relativity square with time as experienced by you and me? All these questions and many more besides well up in the minds of thinking people as soon as they begin to reflect on the nature of time, and in this book Raymond Tallis spells them out clearly, systematically and sympathetically, so as to give the fullest examination to date, both of time as part of the fabric of reality, and of time as the condition of self-conscious experience. He does not solve the mystery, but his argument deepens it in a fascinating way. Written with scholarly rigour and lively humour, this study of the greatest source of our metaphysical anxieties will provide hours of pleasure and instruction to all who delve into it. (Sir Roger Scruton, Senior Fellow, Ethics &amp; Public Policy Center, Washington DC)<br><br>There are few contemporary thinkers who possess either the breadth of Ray Tallis's knowledge or the depth of his scholarship. There are fewer still who can write so cogently and insightfully about the human condition. (Kenan Malik, author of <i>The Quest for a Moral Compass: A Global History of Ethics</i>)<br><br>'You affirm', wrote Albert Einstein to his best friend Michel Besso, that the transition from 'lived experience to objectivity is accompanied by suffering, which &#x2013; if one interprets as a physicist &#x2013; is tied to irreversible processes'. The physicist befuddled by the complexity of the question simply replied, 'I do not know how to help you'. Now Raymond Tallis takes on the challenge, bravely going where few have ventured, investigating the painful nature of time's passage, one intimately felt yet stubbornly denied by numerous scientists. <i>Of Time and Lamentation</i> is an important philosophical investigation, at the same time personal and scholarly &#x2013; a bold and original experiment where art and poetry are given as much importance as science, measurements, equations. (Jimena Canales, Thomas M. Siebel Chair in the History of Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and author of <i>The Physicist and the Philosopher: Einstein, Bergson and the Debate that Changed Our Understanding of Time</i>)<br><br><i>Of Time and Lamentation</i> aims at 'rescuing time from the jaws of physics'. It is a worthy goal and a persuasive argument . . . An absorbing book that will reward the patient reader with a deeper insight into the problem of time. (Andrew Crumey <i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>[Tallis's] monumental of <i>Of Time and Lamentation</i> is a vigorous response to the dominant view that physics has the last word on time . . . I applaud Tallis's assault on scientism (not to be confused with an assault on science), and am glad (and relieved) to see philosophy defended by someone other than an academic philosopher. His view of the nature and purpose of philosophy is both insightful and beautifully expressed . . . [A] fine book. (Robin Le Poidevin <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>[An] astonishing magnum opus, the product of decades of scrupulous, far-reaching, and detailed engagement with a huge range of interlocking disciplines, from medicine and psychology to physics, history, theology and philosophy. It asks the biggest questions, and offers big and challenging answers. (Adam Roberts <i>The New Atlantis</i>)<br><br>It succeeds in something that has defeated many before him. He manages to rescue the study of time from the scientist's arid reductionism, and give it a human face.

Why not both? After Basil Hallward paints a beautiful, young man's portrait, his subject's frivolous wish that the picture change and he remain the same comes true. Dorian Gray's picture grows aged and corrupt while he continues to appear fresh and innocent. After he kills a young woman, "as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife," Dorian Gray is surprised to find no difference in his vision or surroundings. "The roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden." <p> As Hallward tries to make sense of his creation, his epigram-happy friend Lord Henry Wotton encourages Dorian in his sensual quest with any number of Wildean paradoxes, including the delightful "When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy." But despite its many languorous pleasures, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is an imperfect work. Compared to the two (voyeuristic) older men, Dorian is a bore, and his search for ever new sensations far less fun than the novel's drawing-room discussions. Even more oddly, the moral message of the novel contradicts many of Wilde's supposed aims, not least "no artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style." Nonetheless, the glamour boy gets his just deserts. And Wilde, defending Dorian Gray, had it both ways: "All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own punishment."</p>8 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Persuasion (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Set around Lyme Regis and Bath, the story of Anne Elliott&#39;s seven year wait for love is here re-examined by Claude Rawson in his new introduction to Austen&#39;s last completed novel.</p><p>Anne Elliot, heroine of Austen&#39;s last novel, did something we can all relate to: Long ago, she let the love of her life get away. In this case, she had allowed herself to be persuaded by a trusted family friend that the young man she loved wasn&#39;t an adequate match, social stationwise, and that Anne could do better. The novel opens some seven years after Anne sent her beau packing, and she&#39;s still alone. But then the guy she never stopped loving comes back from the sea.

These are the dangers that Kathy Conlan faces when she goes to work. Kathy is a marine biologist who has scuba-dived in oceans off the Arctic and Antarctic -- two of the most hostile environments on Earth. Under the Ice is a fascinating first-person account of a woman scientist at work. Highlights of Kathy&#39;s research on how pollution affects the fragile environments under the ice and stunning photographs of places few will ever visit make this a book readers will be eager to dive into.</p><p>Kathy Conlan is a marine biologist with the Canadian Museum of Nature. She lives in Ottawa, Ontario.Grade 4-8-In this photo-essay, Conlan details her three-month stay in Antarctica, highlighting some of her experiences and her involvement in ongoing experiments relating to the effects of human waste on marine life. Youngsters will enjoy the scientist's accounts of harrowing underwater experiences and diving in the polar regions-suiting up, the dive hut, safety precautions, and dangers-and descriptions of how it feels to be under six feet of ice. Information on the animals that Conlan observed, an introduction to U.S. McMurdo Station (base camp), and a brief history of the first two expeditions to Antarctica in the 1900s allow readers a glimpse of a continent that most people will never have the opportunity to visit. Descriptions of the marine biologist's encounters with playful Weddell seals and Ad&#x201a;lie and Emperor penguins and trips to neon-blue caves full of giant ice crystals, underwater sponge gardens, and glacier caverns add interest, as well. The color photos are clear and appealing. Curiously, most of the book is written in past tense, but the last few pages are written in journal form. Jennifer Owings Dewey's Antarctic Journal (HarperCollins, 2001) and Meredith Hooper's Antarctic Journal (National Geographic, 2001) both concentrate on Antarctic wildlife. Sara Wheeler's Greetings from Antarctica (Peter Bedrick, 1999) includes brief information on life at the pole, penguins and small seals, ice, cooking, and the history of the South Pole and Antarctica, accompanied by lots of diagrams and photos.<br><i>Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, OH</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Socrates&#39; Ancestor: An Essay on Architectural Beginnings</h2><p><p><i>Socrates' Ancestor</i> is a rich and poetic exploration of architectural beginnings and the dawn of Western philosophy in preclassical Greece. Architecture precedes philosophy, McEwen argues, and it was here, in the archaic Greek polis, that Western architecture became the cradle of Western thought. McEwen's appreciation of the early Greek understanding of the indissolubility of craft and community yields new insight into such issues as orthogonal planning and the appearance of the encompassing colonnade - the ptera or "wings" - that made Greek temples Greek. Who was Socrates' ancestor? Socrates claims it was Daedalus, the mythical first architect. Socrates' ancestors were also the first Western philosophers: the preSocratic thinkers of archaic Greece where the Greek city-state with its monumental temples first came to light. McEwen brilliantly draws out the connections between Daedalus and the earliest Greek thinkers, between architecture and the advent of speculative thought. She argues that Greek thought and Greek architecture share a common ground in the amazing fabrications of the legendary Daedalus: statues so animated with divine life that they had to be bound in chains, the Labyrinth where Theseus slew the Minotaur, Ariadne's dancing floor in Knossos. <i>Socrates' Ancestor</i> is an exploration as remarkable for its clarity as for its avoidance of reductionism. Drawing as much on the power of myth and metaphor as on philosophical, philological, and historical considerations, McEwen first reaches backward: from Socrates to the earliest written record of Western philosophy in the Anaximander B1 fragment, and its physical expression in Anaximander's built work - a "cosmic model" that consisted of a celestial sphere, a map of the world, and the first Greek sun clock. From daedalean artifacts she draws out the centrality of early Greek craftsmanship and its role in the making of the Greek city-state. The investigation then moves James forward to a discussion of the polis and the first great peripteral temples that anchored for the meaning of "city."</p></p><p>Indra Kagis McEwen is is an architect and affiliate faculty member in the Art History Department at Concordia University in Montreal.<p>If architecture is concerned with order, its omnipresent origins must be told in connection with the history of philosophy. This extraordinary book is more than an imaginative work of scholarship and a philological <i>tour de force</i>; it is essential reading for architects aware for the need to grasp the story of emerging order at the 'end of modernity,' a time mysteriously a/symmetrical with that of Anaximander.</p>&#x2015;<b>Alberto P�rez-G�mez</b>, Saidye Rosner Bronfman Professor of the History of Architecture, McGill University<br><br><p>McEwen manages, through a learned and indeed dizzying play of tropes and verbal analysis of the relevant Greek terms, to display the processes through which the archaic Greeks, building on mythical figures such as Daedalos, began to think about and organize their cities and temples. It is a virtuoso performance.</p>&#x2015;<b>George Hersey</b>, Professor, Department of the History of Art, Yale University<br><br><p><i>Socrates' Ancestor</i> is a gem of brilliant scholarship. All through the work I encountered insights and observations that answer questions I have nurtured for a long time. McEwen's achievement of uniting the rigor of mature and impeccable scholarship with the world of the imagination that is so often sacrificed in our universities make this book into a text which should be read by all students of architecture and architectural history, and students of classical Greece too.</p>&#x2015;<b>Robert-Jan van Pelt</b>, Associate Professor of Cultural History, School of Architecture, University of Waterloo</p><h2>Classic Ghost Stories (Dover Thrift Editions: Gothic/Horror)</h2><p>Assembled from the works of the finest masters of the genre, these compelling narratives promise to raise gooseflesh and accelerate pulses with their supernatural scenarios.<br>Featured stories include J.

Everyone suggests a different cure for the effects of a weak core: surgeons want to cut, chiropractors want to adjust, physical therapists want to perform physical therapy.&nbsp; In <em>The End of Back Pain,</em> neurosurgeon Patrick Roth, M.D., reveals that, more often than not, back pain is caused by a set of underdeveloped core muscles that control the stability and alignment of the spine that are not being used.

In this lavishly illustrated study, John R. Clarke investigates a rich assortment of Roman erotic art to answer this question&#x2015;and along the way, he reveals a society quite different from our own. Clarke reevaluates our understanding of Roman art and society in a study informed by recent gender and cultural studies, and focusing for the first time on attitudes toward the erotic among both the Roman non-elite and women. This splendid volume is the first study of erotic art and sexuality to set these works&#x2015;many newly discovered and previously unpublished&#x2015;in their ancient context and the first to define the differences between modern and ancient concepts of sexuality using clear visual evidence.<br><br>Roman artists pictured a great range of human sexual activities&#x2015;far beyond those mentioned in classical literature&#x2015;including sex between men and women, men and men, women and women, men and boys, threesomes, foursomes, and more. Roman citizens paid artists to decorate expensive objects, such as silver and cameo glass, with scenes of lovemaking. Erotic works were created for and sold to a broad range of consumers, from the elite to the very poor, during a period spanning the first century B.C. through the mid-third century of our era. This erotic art was not hidden away, but was displayed proudly in homes as signs of wealth and luxury. In public spaces, artists often depicted outrageous sexual acrobatics to make people laugh.<br><br><i>Looking at Lovemaking</i> depicts a sophisticated, pre-Christian society that placed a high value on sexual pleasure and the art that represented it. Clarke shows how this culture evolved within religious, social, and legal frameworks that were vastly different from our own and contributes an original and controversial chapter to the history of human sexuality.</p><p>"Clarke teaches us to think about how this art was understood and felt by those who lived with it in their daily lives and he speculates that it might even reflect what the Romans actually did. This is the first genuinely contextual and theoretically informed study we have of a vast panoply of classical art about sex. It will be an illuminating book for classicists, historians, and anybody else who finds lovemaking interesting."&#x2015;Thomas Laqueur, author of <i>Making Sex</i><br><br>"There are few scholars as able to take on this material, as well versed in theories of sexuality, and as comfortable dealing with both heterosexual and homoerotic content as Clarke. The topic is timely and the execution is professional."&#x2015;Natalie Kampen, Barnard College<br><br>"This book should attract not only classicists, but also scholars of sexuality in any field. Clarke succeeds both in introducing little-known material and in defamiliarizing the familiar examples of erotic art."&#x2015;Anthony Corbeill, University of Kansas<br><br>"<i>Looking at Lovemaking</i> proves that the ancients were very different from you and me&#x2015;that they saw sex not primarily as procreation and never as sin but rather as sport, art, and pleasure, an activity full of humor, tenderness and above all variety. John R. Clarke, by looking at Roman artifacts from several centuries destined to be used by different social classes, reveals that the erotic <i>visual</i> record is far more varied, open-minded and playful than are <i>written</i> moral strictures, which were narrowly formulated by the �lite and for the �lite. This book is at once discreet and bold&#x2015;discreetly respectful of nuance and context, boldly clear in drawing the widest possible conclusions about the malleability of human behavior. Clarke has, with meticulous scholarship and a fresh approach, vindicated Foucault's revolutionary claims for the social construction of sexuality."&#x2015;Edmund White, author of <i>The Beautiful Room is Empty</i><b>John R.

It presents the subject through vivid cases, including most of those beloved by generations of property teachers. In contrast to other casebooks presenting property as a hodge-podge of issues, this book organizes the material in an integrated way, starting with the idea of property as the right to exclude and systematically developing elaborations, exceptions, and counterfoils to this idea. Issues of contemporary relevance such as intellectual property and regulatory takings are given relatively pervasive and expansive treatment.

Every exhibition is different. His installations have featured everything from robotic graffiti writers to entire shipping containers and automobiles, with drawings, sculptures, paintings and found objects roaming freely across the walls, floors and ceilings of exhibition spaces.</p><p>A native of San Francisco, McGee studied painting and printmaking at the San Francisco Art Institute, graduating in 1991. But he also made a name for himself as a graffiti artist, tagging the streets of San Francisco as Ray Fong, Twist and Twisto. He became a leading figure in the 1990s movement known as the Mission School, after the city's celebrated Mission District, and his work continues to bear the marks of that moment&#x2015;the influence of urban, vernacular art forms, the use of nontraditional art materials and a taste for showing work with and among friends.</p><p>In this new volume, McGee has assembled hundreds of artworks and objects&#x2015;his own works and the works of friends and acquaintances. Featuring new paintings, sculptures, photographs and images of site-specific installations, this new volume is an appropriately wide-ranging exploration of the recent work of an artist who defies easy categorization and explanation.</p></p><p><p><strong>Barry McGee</strong> (born 1966) began exhibiting his work in the 1980s--not in a museum or gallery setting but on the streets of San Francisco. In the early 90s he was closely associated with the Mission School and the San Francisco Bay Area's graffiti boom.

His earlier publications have shown how dramatic British innovations in India, including revenue and legal systems, led to fundamental structural changes in Indian social relations. This collection of his writings in the last fifteen years discusses areas in which the colonial impact has generally been overlooked. The essays form a multifaceted exploration of the ways in which the British discovery, collection, and codification of information about Indian society contributed to colonial cultural hegemony and political control.</p><p>Cohn argues that the British Orientalists' study of Indian languages was important to the colonial project of control and command. He also asserts that an arena of colonial power that seemed most benign and most susceptible to indigenous influences--mostly law--in fact became responsible for the institutional reactivation of peculiarly British notions about how to regulate a colonial society made up of "others." He shows how the very Orientalist imagination that led to brilliant antiquarian collections, archaeological finds, and photographic forays were in fact forms of constructing an India that could be better packaged, inferiorized, and ruled. A final essay on cloth suggests how clothes have been part of the history of both colonialism and anticolonialism.</p></p><p><b>Bernard S.

Eakins believed in a classical approach to art, and made no compromises with the mores of his time. His insistence on having female students draw from live male nude models caused him to be dismissed from one important teaching post and created a storm of controversy which substantially hurt his career. Only at the end of his life was his work fully recognized as equal to that of some of the great European old masters. Taken from collections across the globe, this book features a stunning collection of drawings, paintings, and photographs of Eakins's male nudes, which showcase the artist's immense and still influential skill in rendering the male form. A major Eakins retrospective will be at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in the spring of 2002.<br></p><p><b>John Esten</b> has created and designed many books on art, photography, and interior design. A former art director at <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> and<i> L'Officiel USA </i>magazine, he has been guest curator at the Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton, New York, and at the International Center of Photography in New York City. His previous titles include<i> Sargent: Painting Out of Doors, John Singer Sargent: The Male Nudes, </i>and <i>Why Don't You.</i><br>Thomas Eakins's (1844-1916) reputation has long since recovered from the ostracism he suffered when he exposed female drawing students at the Philadelphia Academy of Art to nude male models and was forced to quit teaching. In recent years, the rehabilitation of this 19th-century realist painter has continued, with several books and museum retrospectives of his work. Perhaps, then, it was inevitable that the erotic potential of Eakins's working materials-extensive photographic documentation of the bodies of his male models and students-would be seized upon. This sexy but unnecessary book compiles many of his photographs of nude youths, often engaged in such unlikely athletic pursuits as wrestling, boxing, or tugs-of-war while in the buff in some Arcadian setting. Translated onto canvas by Eakins, these beautifully composed images became lyrical and timeless. Few of the final paintings are seen here, however. Lacking the interpretive analysis contained in Kathleen Foster's excellent Thomas Eakins Rediscovered, this thin volume is instead best thought of as Victorian-era eye candy. Libraries seeking insight into Eakins's visual methods would be better served by Foster's book.<br><i>Douglas F.

Broderick, <em>Learning to Breathe</em><strong></strong>is a secular program that tailors the teaching of mindfulness to the developmental needs of adolescents to help them understand their thoughts and feelings and manage distressing emotions. Students will be empowered by learning important mindfulness meditation skills that help them improve emotion regulation, reduce stress, improve overall performance, and, perhaps most importantly, develop their attention. The book also includes a website link with student handouts and homework assignments, making it an ideal classroom tool.</p><p>The book integrates certain themes of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn, into a program that is shorter, more accessible to students, and compatible with school curricula. Students will learn to pay attention in the moment, manage emotions as they are perceived, and gain greater control over their own feelings and actions. These mindfulness practices offer the opportunity to develop hardiness in the face of uncomfortable feelings that otherwise might provoke a response that could be harmful (e.g. acting out by taking drugs, displaying violent behavior or acting in by becoming more depressed).</p><p>This easy-to-use manual is designed to be used by teachers, but can also be used by any mental health provider teaching adolescents emotion regulation, stress reduction and mindfulness skills.

World Englishes, Implications for International Communication and English Language Teaching, (with an accompanying audio CD) describes selected varieties of World Englishes, and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of selecting a particular variety from the point of view of both teachers and learners. It aims to examine and re-evaluate concepts such as &#39;standard&#39;, &#39;variety&#39;, &#39;native speaker&#39; and &#39;non-native speaker&#39;, and to validate the role played by multilingual and multicultural English language teachers, arguing that context and learner needs should determine the variety to be taught. World Englishes was shortlisted for the 2008 British Council Innovations Awards.</p><p>This book (with accompanying CD) describes selected varieties of World Englishes within the framework of ELT and validates the role of multilingual and multicultural ELT teachers.&#34;...the book offers an extensive, richly illustrated survey of Englishes from around the world.&#34; --English World-Wide</p><h2>American Cut and Engraved Glass: The Brilliant Period in Historical Perspective</h2><p>Identifes cut glass made between 1876 and 1916, shows a variety of pieces, and lists current prices</p><p></p><h2>11 Principles of a Reagan Conservative</h2><p><p>Perhaps no other president's name is invoked by politicians as much as Ronald Reagan's. Every election, as presidential hopefuls jockey for the Republican nomination, each one claims to be a Reagan conservative. But are these candidates truly carrying on the mantle of Ronald Reagan, or are they abusing the memory of our great president? What did Ronald Reagan really believe? In <em>11 Principles of a Reagan Conservative</em>, biographer Paul Kengor analyzes Ronald Reagan's speeches and actions to paint a full, accurate picture of his beliefs. Kengor identifies these principles that lie at the crux of Reagan's conservatism; Freedom, Faith, Family, Sanctity and Dignity of Human Life, American Exceptionalism, The Founders' Wisdom and Vision, Lower Taxes, Limited Government, Peace Through Strength, Anti-Communism, and Belief in the Individual. And it is through these principles that Reagan's modern emulators may create a successful, conservative future.</p> <p>Many a politician has asked: What would Reagan do if he were president now? Where would Reagan stand on today's issues? Who is the next Ronald Reagan? Paul Kengor dissects Reagan's presidency and provides decisive conclusions. The answers to some of these questions may surprise conservatives and liberals alike.</p></p><p><p>Dr. Paul Kengor is professor of political science at Grove City College and executive director of the college's Center for Vision &amp; Values. Kengor is an internationally recognized authority on Ronald Reagan. Kengor is nationally known for his work on the American presidency. He is part of a select group of presidential scholars to participate in C-SPAN's highly regarded ranking of American presidents. A native of Western PA, Kengor lives in Grove City, PA, with his wife and their seven children.</p>No Reagan biographer or scholar knows Ronald Reagan and conservatism like Paul Kengor. If you want to know what's really meant by 'Reagan conservatism, ' Paul Kengor is the guy and this is the book. -- Michael Reagan<br><br>Paul Kengor has done a great job and great service capturing the essence of Reagan's economic ideals. As someone involved with Reaganomics, and particularly tax cuts, I am especially pleased with Kengor's treatment of the subject. We need to properly understand what happened under Ronald Reagan in the 1980s--most notably, the enduring value of his tax cuts, which were a cornerstone of Reagan conservatism. This book gets it right. Nicely done. -- Dr. Arthur B. Laffer, the founder and chairman of Laffer Associates, an economic research firm<br><br>Dr. Paul Kengor's work on Reagan continues the great president's legacy wish to teach, as well as lead. Kengor's keen analysis of Reagan's conservatism will inform and inspire the next generation of conservative leaders as they take up the mantle of the sacred realities that so inspired the Gipper. Respect for individual, adherence to the virtues of the family, lower taxes and a less burdensome government are the values that Reagan fought for, and the standards that should direct the path of his acolytes that follow. Dr. Kengor has proven he is one of those acolytes who will ensure that the legacy of Reagan never dims. -- Senator Rand Paul, (R-KY)<br><br>A clear, concise outline of President Reagan's approach to politics -- and a roadmap to victory for today's conservatives. -- Herb Meyer, Special Assistant to the Director of Central Intelligence and Vice Chairman of the CIA's National Intelligence Council during the Reagan Administration<br><br>Ronald Reagan presents the rare combination of forward-looking with a back-to-basics foundation. No one captures Reagan's practice better than Paul Kengor, and his latest effort is an indispensable guide for everyone who wishes to extend the Reagan legacy for the next generation. -- Steven Hayward, author The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Presidents: From Wilson to Obama (Politically Incorrect Guides)<br><br>Few writers have studied and written about Ronald Reagan more comprehensively than Dr. Paul Kengor. None offers a clearer view of the personal compass (core beliefs) that guided Reagan the man, the conservative leader and, the most successful President in modern history. In 11 Principles of a Reagan Conservative, Kengor spells out the timeless tenets that made Reagan unique in his time, and that can also revive our spirit, enlighten and inspire our people, and restore our purpose to rebuild a strong America for our future. -- Bently Elliott, former director of White House speechwriting under President Reagan<br><br>After eight years with Ronald Reagan as his chief speechwriter, I can say without hesitation that Paul Kengor -- far better than most current historians or journalists -- understands the Reagan heart and mind. Mr. Kengor's research is prodigious, his analysis keen and insightful, his writing clear and his work distinguished. His command of the Reagan legacy is incomparable. -- Tony Dolan, chief speechwriter and Special Assistant and Deputy Assistant to President Reagan<br><br>It's really a handy volume for the young people who won't read longer ones. Paul Kengor reminds us of the building blocks of successful modern conservatism. He adds and multiplies to bring us back together with Ronald Reagan's basic principles that are unifying for all of us. Paul Kengor reminds us of what ties us together. His discussion of Ronald Reagan's principles will inspire future generations to come together and promote a true conservative future. Kengor is a noted authority on Ronald Reagan. This slim volume distills the principles of Reagan for future generations to learn and apply for rebuilding a free society. -- Ed Feulner, retired President of The Heritage Foundation<br><br>There are few historians who are closer students of the Reagan message, his thoughts, his utterances, and his convictions than Paul Kengor. In this primer of Reagan principles, Kengor offers us the heart of the Reagan vision. -- Bill Bennett, Former U.S. Secretary of Education; host of the nationally syndicated radio show Morning in America<br><br>What is a Reagan conservative? That's a question that I, as a Reagan conservative and a Reagan biographer, get asked frequently. It's also a question that few self-described conservatives truly understand. And yet, with all the books on Ronald Reagan, this is the first to undertake an answer. Paul Kengor, himself a Reagan conservative, lays out 11 principles of Reagan conservatism. This book couldn't be more timely and more needed as conservatives look desperately for the next generation of genuine Reagan conservatives. -- Craig Shirley, Reagan biographer and New York Times bestselling author</p><h2>Lancelot: The Knight of the Cart (Chretien de Troyes Romances S)</h2><p>In this outstanding new translation of <i>Lancelot, </i>Burton Raffel brings to English language readers the fourth of Chr�tien&#x2019;s five surviving romantic Arthurian poems.

You&#39;ll find: * All the identification information on a single page-color photographs, range map, and detailed description. No more fumbling to match photos with text! * For fast reference-a compact alphabetical index inside the front and back covers. * More than 900 high-resolution color identification photographs. * An illustrated Quick Guide to the most common backyard and feeder birds. * Convenient colored tabs keyed to each bird group. * Concise and comprehensive text, with information on habitat; plumage variation; feeding, nesting, and mating behavior; bird feeder proclivity; and-for the first time in any guide-population trends and conservation status.</p><p>Together these new field guides cover the continental United States (except western Alaska) and Canada; the 100th meridian is the dividing line between regions. In each volume, the taxonomically arranged species accounts (mostly one per page; occasionally two similar species are combined) include common and scientific names; one to three color photos; terse comments on identifying features, feeding, nesting, other behavior, habitat, voice, and population trends; and a range map. Special "learning pages" precede some difficult groups like gulls and sparrows. Most species of regular occurrence in the region are included; a few extremely local rarities are omitted. The text is clearly written, accurate, and up-to-date; the 1995 AOU (American Ornithologists' Union) Checklist changes are included. With so many other North American bird guides from the Audubon Society, Roger Tory Peterson, and others currently in print, any new guide should meet some special need. These works are particularly suited to novice birders. Putting all the data about a species on a single page facilitates use (e.g., it isn't possible to depict every varying plumage of all species), and the intentional omission of rarities that barely reach the region is valid. The inclusion of population data is unique and valuable. These titles supplement but do not supplant existing guides; the appropriate regional volume is recommended for public and academic libraries.?Paul B.

But what if we took these big, hard-to-imagine objects and events and compared them to things we can see, feel and touch? Instantly, we'd see our world in a whole new way.? So begins this endlessly intriguing guide to better understanding all those really big ideas and numbers children come across on a regular basis. Author David J. Smith has found clever devices to scale down everything from time lines (the history of Earth compressed into one year), to quantities (all the wealth in the world divided into one hundred coins), to size differences (the planets shown as different types of balls). Accompanying each description is a kid-friendly drawing by illustrator Steve Adams that visually reinforces the concept. <br><br> By simply reducing everything to human scale, Smith has made the incomprehensible easier to grasp, and therefore more meaningful. The children who just love these kinds of fact-filled, knock-your-socks-off books will want to read this one from cover to cover. It will find the most use, however, as an excellent classroom reference that can be reached for again and again when studying scale and measurement in math, and also for any number of applications in social studies, science and language arts. For those who want to delve a little deeper, Smith has included six suggestions for classroom projects. There is also a full page of resource information at the back of the book.</p><p>David J. Smith is a teacher and educational consultant with over 25 years of experience in the classroom and is the creator of the award-winning curriculum "Mapping the World by Heart."<p>Steve Adams has collaborated with a wide range of publications, including the Wall Street Journal, the Chicago Tribune and the Globe and Mail. He has also illustrated eight children's books. He lives in Montreal, Quebec.</p>Gr 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;Following in the footsteps of his If America Were a Village (2009) and If the World Were a Village (2011, both Kids Can), Smith again scales down large concepts and numbers for young readers with a focus on worldly concepts. Topics ranging from our galaxy, solar system, world history, inventions, world population, and energy and food production are related to familiar everyday objects, so children can easily grasp the relationship between these big ideas. For instance: if all of Earth's water was represented by 100 drinking glasses, 97 glasses would be filled with salt water, while only three would be filled with fresh water. Only one of the three is accessible, as the remaining two would be found in glaciers, frozen in the atmosphere, or deep underground. Adams's beautiful illustrations, reminiscent of folk art, vividly portray the concepts but may occasionally lead to some confusion. When presenting world life expectancy as footprints in the sand, the illustration makes it seem as though North Americans live the longest at 78 years (with 78 footprints), but only when reading the side panel is it stated that residents of some countries would have 83 footprints. Furthermore, Smith's time lines are brief and may overlook events some find most relevant (for instance, he doesn't include the automobile on the time line of Inventions of the Last 1000 Years). An author's note provides suggestions for additional scale activities, and a list of useful books and websites can be found as well. Overall, the text serves as an excellent discussion starter and bridge to comprehending big concepts. A solid suggestion for fact-focused young readers.&#x2014;Meaghan Darling, Plainsboro Public Library, NJ</p><h2>Ten Things Every Child with Autism Wishes You Knew, 3rd Edition: Revised and Updated</h2><p><p>One of the autism community&#x2019;s most beloved classics, <em><strong>Ten Things Every Child with Autism Wishes You Knew</strong></em> has informed, delighted, and guided millions of families and professionals the world over since its first edition was published in 2005.

A true &#x201c;renaissance man,&#x201d; Mayerne&#x2019;s interests were broad, and due to considerable conspiratorial talent, he became a participant in bluff and intrigue at the highest levels.<br><br> The most ambitious and perhaps the most original of all Trevor-Roper's books, written in his luminous prose, this is a major work of political and intellectual history that presents a whole period in a fresh and vivid light.</p><p>The late <b>Hugh Trevor-Roper</b> was Regius Professor of History at the University of Oxford. His many previous books include the bestselling biography of Sir Edmund Backhouse, <i>The Hermit of Peking</i>, and <i>The Last Days of Hitler</i>.<br><br><i>Starred Review.</i> The celebrated English historian Trevor-Roper, bestselling author of <i>The Last Days of Hitler</i>, wrote relatively few books but many essays, nearly all about the Renaissance and the Reformation. After his death in 2003, a search of his papers uncovered this full-length manuscript, composed in the 1970s and worked on periodically thereafter; it has been diligently and sensitively edited by Blair Worden. Trevor-Roper, always fascinated by the intersection of medicine and politics, examines the life of Sir Theodore de Mayerne, personal physician to three kings&#x2014;Henry IV of France, James I and Charles I of England&#x2014;as well as secret agent and diplomat, chemist and alchemist. Trevor-Roper wrote this as a "layman's book," and it is less a detailed history of medicine than a portrait of a remarkable man in the still more remarkable social and intellectual world of the 17th century. Often remembered now for his overhurried "authentication" of the Hitler Diaries, an unfortunate error he was never allowed to forget, Trevor-Roper posthumously demonstrates his mastery as a historian, detective and narrative stylist. One hopes there are yet more unpublished manuscripts lurking among his papers, but if there are not, then this book stands as a fine capstone to a brilliant career.<i> (Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The first American novel to provide a devastatingly accurate portrait of New York's aristocracy, it is the story of the beautiful and beguiling Lily Bart and her ill-fated attempt to rise to the heights of a heartless society in which, ultimately, she has no part. <br> From the staid conventionality of Old New York to the forced conviviality of the French Riviera, from the drawing room of Gus Trenor's Bellomont to the dreary resort of a downtown boardinghouse, Wharton created her "first full-scale survey," as her biographer R.W.B. Lewis put it, "of the com�die humaine, American style." A brilliantly satiric yet sensitive exploration of manners and morality, <i>The House of Mirth</i> marked Wharton's transformation from an amateur into a professional writer and figures among her most important works.</p><p>"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth," warns Ecclesiastes 7:4, and so does the novel by Edith Wharton that takes its title from this call to heed. New York at the turn of the century was a time of opulence and frivolity for those who could afford it. But for those who couldn't and yet wanted desperately to keep up with the whirlwind, like Wharton's charming Lily Bart, it was something else altogether: a gilded cage rather than the Gilded Age. <p> One of Wharton's earliest descriptions of her heroine, in the library of her bachelor friend and sometime suitor Lawrence Selden, indicates that she appears "as though she were a captured dryad subdued to the conventions of the drawing room." Indeed, herein lies Lily's problem. She has, we're told, "been brought up to be ornamental," and yet her spirit is larger than what this ancillary role requires. By today's standards she would be nothing more than a mild rebel, but in the era into which Wharton drops her unmercifully, this tiny spark of character, combined with numerous assaults by vicious society women and bad luck, ultimately renders Lily persona non grata. Her own ambivalence about her position serves to open the door to disaster: several times she is on the verge of "good" marriage and squanders it at the last moment, unwilling to play by the rules of a society that produces, as she calls them, "poor, miserable, marriageable girls.</p><p> Lily's rather violent tumble down the social ladder provides a thumbnail sketch of the general injustices of the upper classes (which, incidentally, Wharton never quite manages to condemn entirely, clearly believing that such life is cruel but without alternative). From her start as a beautiful woman at the height of her powers to her sad finale as a recently fired milliner's assistant addicted to sleeping drugs, Lily Bart is heroic, not least for her final admission of her own role in her downfall. "Once--twice--you gave me the chance to escape from my life and I refused it: refused it because I was a coward," she tells Selden as the book draws to a close. All manner of hideous socialite beasts--some of whose treatment by Wharton, such as the token social-climbing Jew, Simon Rosedale, date the book unfortunately--wander through the novel while Lily plummets. As her tale winds down to nothing more than the remnants of social grace and cold hard cash, it's hard not to agree with Lily's own assessment of herself: "I have tried hard--but life is difficult, and I am a very useless person. I can hardly be said to have an independent existence. I was just a screw or a cog in the great machine I called life, and when I dropped out of it I found I was of no use anywhere else." Nevertheless, it's even harder not to believe that she deserved better, which is why <i>The House of Mirth</i> remains so timely and so vital in spite of its crushing end and its unflattering portrait of what life offers up. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Build a Drone: A Step-by-Step Guide to Designing, Constructing, and Flying Your Very Own Drone</h2><p><b>Whether you plan on using drones for recreation or a more serious purpose (from search and rescue through farming to scanning construction work on a high-rise apartment buildings), <i>Build a Drone</i> will make sure that you not only understand how to construct a drone, but the proper and safe ways to maintain and handle them.</b><br><br>Within the last couple of years, the usage of drones in both the public and private (military) sector has exploded.

He entered Boston Grammar School when he was eight and later attended George Brown Ell&#x2019;s school. When he was twelve his father apprenticed him to his half-brother James as a printer. James was later the publisher of the <b>New England Courant</b>, where Franklin&#x2019;s first articles, <b>The Dogood Papers</b>, were published before he was seventeen. He went to Philadelphia in 1723 and pursued his trade of printer. He was befriended by William Keith, Governor of Pennsylvania, who offered to help the young man get started in business. Franklin left for England, where he hoped to arrange for the purchase of printing equipment. Arriving in London in 1724, he was soon deserted by Keith, and again turned to printing for a livelihood. His privately printed <b>Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain</b> (1725) introduced him to leading Deists and other intellectuals in London. A year later, he returned to Philadelphia, and by 1730 he had been appointed public printer for Pennsylvania. In 1731 he established the first circulation library in the United States; in 1743-44, The American Philosophical Society. In 1748 he retired from the trade of printer but continued to advise and back his partner and to draw profit from the business. <b>Poor Richard&#x2019;s Almanack</b> was his most spectacular success as a publisher, having gone through numerous editions and been translated in many languages. During the next thirty-five years he devoted himself largely to politics and diplomacy, but still wrote and engaged in scientific ventures. He resigned as Minister to France in 1785, returned to America, and was elected President of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Still concerned with the rights of the individual, he published papers encouraging the abolition of slavery. He died in Philadelphia in 1790.The reader seems to see many Franklins, one emerging from another like those brightly painted Russian dolls which, ever smaller, disclose yet one more.</p><h2>Chicago Death Trap: The Iroquois Theatre Fire of 1903</h2><p><p>On the afternoon of December 30, 1903, during a sold-out matinee performance, a fire broke out in Chicago&#x2019;s Iroquois Theatre. In the short span of twenty minutes, more than six hundred people, two thirds of whom were women and children, were asphyxiated, burned, or trampled to death in a panicked mob&#x2019;s failed attempt to escape. A century after the fire the deadliest in American history Nat Brandt provides the only detailed chronicle of this horrific event to assess not only the titanic tragedy of the fire itself but also the municipal corruption and greed that kindled the flames beforehand and the political cover-ups hidden in the smoke and ash afterwards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Advertised as absolutely fireproof,&#x201d; the Iroquois was Chicago&#x2019;s most modern playhouse when it opened in the fall of 1903. With the approval of the city&#x2019;s building department, theater developers Harry J. Powers and William J. Davis opened the theater prematurely to take full advantage of the holiday crowds, ignoring flagrant safety violations in the process. During the matinee on this particular Wednesday, all 1,724 seats were filled and an additional two hundred people were standing.<b> </b><b></b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Midway through the second act, a spark from a defective light ignited a drop curtain and the blaze spread quickly to the scenery. Roof vents designed to handle smoke and heat were sealed off, and the fire curtain snagged before it could shield the audience from danger. A blast of gaseous fumes shot across the auditorium from an open stage door and asphyxiated hundreds of theatergoers almost instantly. Others were trampled or burned to death in the panic that ensued as they struggled to escape through locked exits, succeeding only in piling body upon body as the flames closed in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For days afterward, Chicago mourned as relatives and friends searched hospitals for&nbsp;missing loved ones. The aftermath of the fire proved to be a study in the miscarriage of justice.

Rawls argues that the correct principles of justice are those that would be agreed to by free and rational persons, placed in the &#39;original position&#39; behind a veil of ignorance: not knowing their own place in society; their class, race, or sex; their abilities, intelligence, or strengths; or even their conception of the good. Accordingly, he derives two principles of justice to regulate the distribution of liberties, and of social and economic goods. In this revised edition the work is presented as Rawls himself wishes it to be transmitted to posterity, with numerous minor revisions and amendments and a new Preface in which Rawls reflects on his presentation of his thesis and explains how and why he has revised it.</p><p><b>John Rawls</b> was James Bryant Conant University Professor at Harvard University.

Now Oxford, in association with the Newberry Library, has published an outstanding two-volume set for high-school and college students and adults. The Oxford Companion to World Exploration traverses the complete spectrum of world exploration, from the ancient world through current underwater and space exploration. Its 800 entries cover places, people, history, literature, myths, science, and organizations. The text is supplemented by 220 black-and-white and 75 color illustrations and maps, many taken from the Newberry Library's outstanding collection. Arranged in A&#x2013;Z format, entries range from several paragraphs to 20 or more pages and are written by scholars who are experts on the subject. Each ends with cross-references and a bibliography of relevant books and articles. Boxed excerpts from explorers' journals, letters, and books accompany many of the biographical entries. The set also has a topical outline with all the entries listed under 16 subject categories, a directory of all the contributors, and a very comprehensive 100-page index. The well-written essays do more than just give the basic facts; they interpret the subject so its importance in the scheme of exploration is explained. The 27-page essay on Africa includes subentries on not only the history of exploration of the continent but also on geographical barriers to exploration, the role of indigenous porters and guides, and the motives of patrons and sponsors. The article on Alexander the Great covers not only the facts of his expeditions but also the literature of legends that grew up around his exploits and how these legends influenced later explorers. Entries on Atlantis, Chinese exile writers, El Dorado, Fictitious and fantastic places, Imagery of exploration,Travel literature, and more expand the concept of exploration and show how fiction and literature shaped views of foreign lands. At the same size and price, the Encyclopedia of Exploration (Facts On File, 2004) covers similar material. Both sets include articles on exploration of the different continents, with the Facts on File set giving a straight history, while Oxford tends to provide more interpretation of that history. The Facts On File set takes a more granular approach, with 950 entries for people as well as entries for subjects such as aerial photography and the American Geographical Society, while Oxford generally covers broader topics in fewer, longer articles. Even though both sets cover much of the same material, they bring out different aspects and facts on each subject so are not necessarily duplicative. With its articles on the literature and legends of exploration and travel, in addition to historical articles and biographies, The Oxford Companion to World Exploration is a valuable reference set that high-school, adademic, and public libraries should add to their collections.

He'd already lost me at "quad sets," which sounded like four games of tennis. But "neuromuscular isometric"? <br><br>"Seriously?" I blurted out, trying not to laugh.<br><br>His gaze narrowed. "Mrs. Higgs, do you plan on walking again?"<br><br>I sat up straighter in bed, wincing as pain ricocheted through my newly installed bionic knee. "Use all the big words you like. Just tell me what to do." <br><br>Following his instructions, I stretched out my leg, pointed my toes toward the ceiling, and slowly pressed the back of my knee into the bed. He counted while I held my muscles in place for ten seconds. After several repetitions I shrugged. "That's it? I barely moved."<br><br>"Good. Now ten more." <br><br>Once he assured me each rep would strengthen my knee and improve my range of motion, I stopped asking questions and started doing quad sets, ankle pumps, seated knee extensions, and all the other exercises on his clipboard. In due time I was mobile again, amazed at how a series of seemingly minor steps had carried me along the path to wellness.<br><br>Which brings me to you, to this book, to right now. <br><br>You and I will be walking step-by-step through thirty-one verses from the book of Proverbs. Left to my own devices, I might have picked only the upbeat verses, the cheerful ones. But when I asked hundreds of women to choose their favorites, they were wise enough to know that we learn more-and grow faster-when our thinking is challenged and our motives and actions are considered.<br><br>So as we look at the verses together, you'll likely find many are comforting, some are a bit unsettling, and a few may squash your toes, as they did mine. Yet you can be sure God crafted each word in Proverbs for your benefit, since He promises to "instruct you in the way of wisdom and lead you along straight paths."1 <br><br>Clearly, God will do the leading. I'm here to keep you company.<br><br>We'll be taking a word-by-word-by-word approach to Bible study. My theory? Better to chew slowly and savor each phrase than to swallow a passage whole and not remember what we ate. <br><br>I've used more than thirty different English translations to capture the subtle nuances of the original Hebrew and enrich our understanding of His Word. If you're curious about notations such as ASV, which denotes the American Standard Version, you'll find a complete list of translations and their abbreviations on page 000. I've also included a Study Guide that further explores each chapter. You might answer the questions as you go, or you may decide to gather with a group of friends and use 31 Proverbs to Light Your Path as a six-week Bible study.<br><br>At first glance the book of Proverbs appears to be a long list of rules about right living. More than one mom has thought about marching up to her teenager's bedroom door and demanding, "How long will you lie there, you sluggard?"2 And more than one employee has been tempted to tell a coworker who peppers his speech with four-letter words, "Keep corrupt talk far from your lips."3 <br><br>If you're looking for dos and don'ts, Proverbs has plenty to offer. <br><br>But the deeper truth it contains is wisdom. We'll discover why God calls us to righteousness and how He makes being good possible. We'll learn about our human nature and His divine nature, about the dark alleys to avoid and the well-lit paths to follow. God says of His Word, "This command is a lamp, this teaching is a light, and correction and instruction are the way to life."4 <br><br>My goal is not to show you how to be good. My goal is to show you how good God is.<br><br>At the end of each chapter, I've added a simple challenge-"One Minute, One Step"-a do-it-now task that requires sixty seconds or less. If you have a notepad, a pen, a Bible, your purse, some stationery, and your phone, that's all you'll need. By moving straight from words to actions, we can immediately apply what we've learned and discover how God uses even the smallest steps to lead us in the right direction. <br><br>When you reach the "One Minute, One Step" prompt, I hope you'll resist the urge to close the book, thinking, Great idea! I'll try that later, and instead just do it. Sixty seconds max, I promise. Think of it as a spiritual quad set-a tiny but powerful exercise to get you on your feet and on the move for God.<br><br>His light is shining, and the path ahead is clear. Ready when you are, beloved.<br><br>1<br><br>Morning by Morning<br><br>The path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day. PROVERBS 4:18<br><br>I rose earlier than usual one morning, nudged awake by two cats impatient for breakfast. The sky outside our kitchen window was a deep navy blue, the birdsong was lively, and the windowpanes were cold to the touch. As I gazed at the eastern horizon, the sky slowly grew lighter. If I watched without turning away, the change was too gradual to measure, but if I glanced down for a moment and then looked up, the difference was remarkable.<br><br>Our spiritual growth is much the same. Morning by morning we may not see any noticeable improvement in our thought patterns or behavior. But as we read God's Word, as we worship, as we pray, as we fellowship with other believers, as we serve Him with gladness, as we give away our resources to help others, the light of His love continues to rise in our hearts until it shows in our words and shines on our faces.<br><br>Now let's see what this verse from Proverbs has for us.<br><br>The path of the righteous... Proverbs 4:18<br><br>Very promising, the word path. God doesn't expect us to get where we're going all at once. This "road the righteous travel" (GNT), this "way of those who do right" (VOICE) is a pathway, not an expressway.<br><br>As to our being righteous, that is entirely the Lord's work. Righteousness isn't about our goodness; it's about God's goodness. We can't become "right-living people" (MSG) on our own. Our walk with Him is upright only because He bent down to carry a cross.<br><br>It's His Spirit in us that prompts us to say and do the right things-to be loving, joyful, peaceful, patient, kind, good, faithful, gentle, and disciplined.1 All that delicious fruit of the Spirit is produced when we depend on God, not when we depend on our own strength. What a relief!<br><br>This is how our daily journey is meant to look and feel:<br><br>...is like the morning sun,... Proverbs 4:18<br><br>That "first gleam of dawn" (NLT), that "early morning light" (NLV) is not only pure; it's also sure. The sun never changes its mind, never chooses not to rise, never goes back to bed. It keeps moving, tracing a steady path across the sky. Even when threatening clouds hover over us, even when wild storms rage inside us, far above those thunderheads, the sun still shines. <br><br>Because of His power, we, too, can keep shining. Because of His Son, the light of the world, we can "glow" (MSG) despite our circumstances. We are still His people. He is still our God. Nothing will ever change that. Nothing.<br><br>You and I are counted among those who walk the path of the righteous, based not on how we act but on whom we follow. "The LORD is trustworthy in all he promises and faithful in all he does."2 What He does is shine in us.<br><br>...shining ever brighter... Proverbs 4:18<br><br>He who created light and called it good also created you and called you righteous. You may be thinking, That's fine, Liz, but life isn't "growing brighter and brighter" (EXB) at my house, and I'm definitely not feeling that my path is "clearer" (AMPC) with each passing day.<br><br>I hear you. I'm with you. That's why God calls us to focus on truth. Rather than trust our ever-changing emotions, He wants us to trust what His Word tells us: "This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe."3 <br><br>Do you believe, dear friend? Then count on God for the "brightening" (YLT) that is certain to appear. Don't look in the mirror. Look in His Word. See? It's coming.<br><br>...till the full light of day. Proverbs 4:18<br><br>Jesus promised, "Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."4 His light. His life. When do we reach "full light"? When we stand before His throne on that "perfect day" (ASV). Until then we live "in the ever-brightening light of God's favor" (TLB), with our faith expanding and our confidence strengthening. <br><br>By the very nature of the maturing process, we begin each day with more knowledge, more wisdom, and more experience than we had the day before. For those who love God, "the longer they live, the brighter they shine" (MSG). Why dread your next birthday when each year brings you closer to the One who loves you more than anyone on earth ever could?<br><br>A glorious day will come-just imagine it!-when we say with our faces lifted in awe, "Good morning, Lord." May the anticipation of that joyous moment propel us forward on our path, knowing we are moving in the right direction: toward Him.<br><br>***<br><br>Lord Jesus, help me turn away from darkness, disappointment, and discouragement to gaze steadily at You, my Source of light and life, my sun and my shield. Strengthen my trust in You for the big things, for the small things, for all things. Remind me that, as sure as the sun rises every morning, Your goodness and righteousness will shine on me and in me, morning by morning, brighter and brighter. <br><br>ONE MINUTE, ONE STEP<br><br>Invite more light into your life.<br><br>Look around for an easy way to brighten your immediate surroundings. Open a curtain, pull up a window blind, or maybe turn on more lights. You might try dusting a light bulb you can easily reach. The lamp should be turned off and the bulb cool. Carefully wipe it clean with a soft cloth or dryer sheet, and then turn on the lamp. Surprise! A significant difference, yes?<br><br>Now that you've added more light, what do you see that you didn't notice before?<br><br>The path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day.

She has been a Knight Science Journalism Fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Science Journalism Fellow at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. She lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. www.anngibbons.comCHAPTER ONE<br><br>AFRICAN TRAILBLAZERS<br><br>Most scientific problems are far better understood by studying their history than their logic. <br>-Ernst Mayr, evolutionary biologist<br><br>I was told as a young student not to waste my time searching for Early Man in Africa, since "everyone knew he had started in Asia."<br>-Louis Leakey, 1966<br><br>It was an October morning in 2003. Meave Leakey was driving from Nairobi north along the eastern wall of the Rift Valley in central Kenya, expertly weaving around potholes in the tarmac and dodging oncoming buses that played chicken with smaller vehicles to scare them out of their way. Trucks belched black smoke that stung her eyes, cyclists hitched rides up hills holding on to the backs of buses, and jam-packed public shuttles called matatus spent almost as much time passing each other as staying on their side of the two-lane road. As Meave negotiated this nerve-racking traffic on the Uplands Road between Nairobi and Nakuru, she calmly recounted the story of how the search for human ancestors began in eastern Africa. "Until the middle of 1959, only a few people seriously believed eastern Africa was a sensible place to look for the earliest human ancestors," she said.<br><br>This history is personal for her, because it is the saga of her husband's parents, Louis and Mary Leakey. This formidable pair was among the first to stake their careers on Africa as the birthplace of mankind. For three decades, their work in eastern Africa was an almost solitary pursuit. Even those researchers who found fossils of early ape-men in South Africa during that time had trouble convincing their European colleagues that these primitive fossils were ancestors of humans. Then, in 1959, Mary found a fossil in Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, that would finally give the Leakeys the hard evidence they had long sought that early humans did indeed evolve in eastern Africa. Louis named the cranium, or partial skull, <i>Zinjanthropus boisei</i>--<i>Zinj</i> from an Arabic word for eastern Africa, <i>anthropus</i> from the Greek word for man, and <i>boisei</i> from Charles Boise, a London businessman who was their benefactor. Translated, the name is an assertion: "Man from Eastern Africa." And once the Man from Eastern Africa made his appearance, the push was on to find more extinct men and women. Soon, teams of French and American researchers headed to eastern Africa, like forty-niners to California during the gold rush. The fossils they found in the Great Rift Valley in the 1960s and 1970s soon made it known as the cradle of humanity.<br><br>But Louis's search for the missing link in eastern Africa had started more than thirty years earlier, right in the gullies and rock shelters alongside the Uplands Road where Meave was driving nearly eighty years later, high above the Great Rift Valley. In 1926, the first year that Louis worked in the area, the Uplands Road did not exist, and the trip from Nairobi in Louis's Model T Ford took a half day over muddy tracks. The air was so clear that Louis could see miles across the Great Rift Valley from his camp, down a slope covered with acacia trees and scrub brush to Lake Elmenteita, a shallow alkaline lake rimmed with the pink froth of flamingos. Bush babies, leopards, aardvarks, and ibises lived in the acacia woodlands near the shore, and a herd of hippos wallowed in the lake. Beyond the lake, the jagged calderas of several extinct volcanoes lined up to form the silhouette of a human figure that the local Masai tribesmen called Elngiragata Olmorani, for Sleeping Warrior. A few British settlers were staking out the Masai's traditional grazing grounds for homesteads for cattle ranches, but otherwise the area was still remote and primeval.<br><br>Today, Elmenteita is only an hour's drive beyond the shanty sprawl surrounding Nairobi, and much of the land around the lake is fenced in by private owners. The hippos are gone and the bush babies and a few remaining leopards have retreated to a wildlife sanctuary. But the view of the rift valley far below is still stunning, and Meave named the volcanoes visible in the distance as she searched for a familiar turnoff. Spotting it, she jostled down a dirt road, past a quarry where workers mined a crumbly white rock called diatomite, and pulled into a grassy driveway. The sign said: Kariandusi Museum, National Museums of Kenya. It did not look like much: a guard's hut and a whitewashed, single-room museum with some casts of skulls and an exhibit on the formation of the Great Rift Valley. It was clearly off the tourists' safari circuit.<br><br>A curator eventually appeared, delighted to find someone who wanted to tour the site on a Monday in October. He was even more surprised to find out that the tall woman with straight, silver-gray hair and hazel eyes spoke Swahili and was a member of the Leakey family--a name that is well-known in Kenya. At sixty-one, Meave had been here many times before and knew the history of Kariandusi by heart. She is long-legged and fit after a lifetime of hard work scrambling over rugged terrain for fossils, and she did not need a guide to lead her into the gulch. She let the curator show her the way to a series of steplike pits anyway, partly because she was curious to learn what he knew. He took her to the first pit, which was covered with a corrugated metal roof. Meave leaned over the rail and pointed to the dirt floor encrusted with hundreds of stone tools, most made of glassy black obsidian, the rock that comes from volcanic lava. There were tear-shaped hand axes, two-sided flakes, and even triplets of round stones that look like black billiard balls. "This is where it all began," said Meave. She was referring to Louis's search for early man in eastern Africa. These shiny black tools at Kariandusi were among the first hard evidence of a sophisticated ancient Stone Age culture in eastern Africa. They were made by people who left them on the shores of the lake almost 500,000 years ago, perhaps when they came to hunt wild animals that were quenching their thirst at dawn or dusk. She climbed down wooden stairs into a deep gully where an ibis was roosting in a tree. Meave remembered a photo from <i>National Geographic</i> that showed Louis bending over a cliff there, pointing to stone tools embedded in the wall. This was precisely the spot where Louis and his team found their first ancient hand axes in eastern Africa in 1929.<br><br> * * * <br><br>In 1871, less than sixty years earlier, Charles Darwin had proposed in <i>The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex</i>, that the earliest ancestors of humans probably lived on the African continent. But that prediction was based on absolutely no evidence from fossils. In fact, at the time only one fossil of another type of human being was known, and that was of a Neandertal that had lived in the Neander valley of Germany sometime in the past 70,000 years. Darwin chose Africa because humans' closest cousins in the animal kingdom--chimpanzees and gorillas--lived in Africa; therefore, he wrote, "it is more probable that our early progenitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere." But Darwin admitted that it was "useless to speculate on this subject," since an extinct European ape nearly as large as humans could also have given rise to humans.<br><br>That didn't stop Darwin's colleagues from conjecture. His friend and champion Thomas Henry Huxley (also known as Darwin's "bulldog") agreed that humans should be put in the same family as chimpanzees and gorillas, and enthusiastically promoted that view in debates and in his 1863 book <i>Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature</i>. (Darwin himself avoided dealing directly with the issue until 1871, when he published <i>The Descent of Man</i>.) But a contemporary and admirer of Darwin's, the prominent German biologist Ernst Haeckel, believed that the Asian apes (orangutans and gibbons) were closer relatives of humans than the African apes were. Haeckel proposed this link in his sketches of the human family tree in 1868, drawing a direct line between Asian apes and a new species of fossil human that he proposed and explicitly called the missing link. In his writings and lectures, Haeckel fleshed out this missing link as a hairy, primitive creature half ape, half man, named <i>Pithecanthropus alalus</i>. (Literally, "ape-man without speech," from the Greek <i>pithec</i>, "ape," <i>anthropus</i>, "man," and <i>alalus</i>, "without speech.") It walked semierect, had protruding teeth, and was speechless. But there wasn't a bit of hard evidence to support this vision of an ape-man. Haeckel's missing link was purely theoretical.<br><br>One person who heard of Haeckel's ideas on human evolution was a young Dutch medical student, Eug�ne Dubois, who became the first of a long line of young men obsessed with finding this missing link--and winning honor and fortune. In 1887, when Dubois couldn't get the Dutch government to finance an expedition to the tropics to search for fossils, he quit his job as an anatomist at the University of Amsterdam and joined the Royal Dutch East Indies Army as a military doctor so he could be posted to the Dutch East Indies, now the Indonesian archipelago. Ancient fossils of mammals that had been alive during the earliest stages of the Age of Man (the Pleistocene epoch) had been found there. He thought it most likely that fossils of extinct ancestors of similar age would be preserved there as well. According to his biographer, the anthropologist Pat Shipman, he also reasoned that if apes lived in the tropics today, extinct apes and early ape-men would also have been more likely to live in the tropics.<br><br>It was an incredible long shot, but he sailed for the Dutch East Indies at the age of twenty-nine with his young wife and their baby. Dubois was the first of many fossil hunters to risk his life in search of an elusive missing link. He battled malarial fever without modern medicines; his team hemorrhaged workers, who ran away, became ill, or stole fossils to sell as "dragon" bones to traders from China; and they faced bad roads through the overgrown jungles of Java, mosquitoes, hellish heat, and torrential rains. Amazingly, Dubois and his family survived. More incredibly, he found what he was looking for. In August 1891, his crew discovered the molar of a hominid eroding out of the banks of the Solo River near the village of Trinil on the island of Java. Two months later, his crew found a skullcap that was larger than that of a chimpanzee's but smaller than that of a human's. Later, they found a thighbone. Dubois recognized the skullcap as belonging to a species that must have had a brain intermediate in size and development between humans and apes. But the thighbone belonged to a creature that walked upright--even before its brain had expanded.<br><br>He pronounced it <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i> (or "erect ape-man"). It was an amazing feat. He had never searched for fossils but had nonetheless traveled halfway around the world to an island archipelago where he'd <i>reasoned </i>that such fossils should be found. Today, Dubois's Java man is still recognized as a major discovery--the first fossil found of an early hominid and the first specimen of <i>Homo erectus</i> (as it was later renamed), a key human ancestor that arose about 1.8 million years ago, probably in Africa, before migrating to Asia, where it persisted until sometime in the past 250,000 years. This species of human and its descendants may even have lived until as recently as 13,000 years ago in the form of the so-called Hobbit, the dwarf species of human whose remains were found in 2004 on the Indonesian island of Flores.<br><br>Convincing his colleagues that he had found the missing link would prove more difficult than finding the fossils themselves. When Dubois announced his discovery of Java man in 1893, he expected honor and scientific recognition. Instead, his monograph on this "man-ape" was met with skepticism and snide comments, some dismissing the fossil as a giant gibbon or an individual whose features had been distorted by disease or a wound. Word reached him in Java in 1894 that his European colleagues questioned many aspects of his monograph on the fossil--from his claim that all the fossils came from the same individual to the way his crew had mapped the fossil site.<br><br>Dubois traveled to Europe in 1895 to defend his discovery, winning a few converts as he lectured and displayed the bones themselves. Haeckel, who had inspired him, was one who embraced Java man as a human ancestor. But the theory of evolution was still new and was not universally accepted among scholars. Although Dubois was well educated and a meticulous scientist, perhaps the real problem was that an ancestor that looked so much like an ape was more than the scientific establishment of the late nineteenth century could accept. His biographer Shipman concluded, "In truth, the problem lay more in the prevailing beliefs among his colleagues than in Dubois' shortcomings."<br><br>As he battled his colleagues well into the twentieth century, Dubois's own shortcomings also became apparent--he grew secretive and territorial about his fossils, particularly after he gave a cast to a German anatomist who then toured the world with it, giving lectures and publishing a detailed description about Java man before Dubois had finished his own analysis of the skull he had found. After that, he withdrew from his colleagues and even rigged a mirror above his door at home so he could see who was there when his maid answered, turning away prominent scientists who'd traveled from as far as America to see the fossils that he stored in his basement.<br><br>History would prove Dubois right about Java man, but he died an angry man, unrecognized and estranged from his wife and friends--all alienated by his increasing irascibility. He was, perhaps, the first fossil hunter to become a victim of his own success in finding a human ancestor, as if the fossil came with a mummy's curse.<br><br>It was a bitter omen of the kind of controversy that would swirl around almost every new fossil vying to be a human ancestor. Even experienced researchers often react with more emotion to the discovery of human ancestors than they do to fossils of any other animal, including dinosaurs. New fossils almost always shatter preconceived notions of what our ancestors should look like, revealing our origins as ordinary apes rather than as exalted beings marked from the beginning with a big brain or some other sign of special destiny. Darwin recognized this reflexive denial of our savage past in <i>The Descent of Man </i>when he warned, "We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his god-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system--with all these exalted powers--Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."</p><h2>The Secret of the Unicorn (The Adventures of Tintin) (Adventures of Tintin (Hardcover))</h2><p>Herge&#39;s classic comic book creation Tintin is one of the most iconic characters in children&#39;s books. These highly collectible editions of the original 24 adventures will delight Tintin fans old and new. Perfect for lovers of graphic novels, mysteries and historical adventures. The world&#39;s most famous travelling reporter learns the secret of the Unicorn. When Tintin stumbles across a model ship at the Old Street Market, he buys it as a gift for his friend Captain Haddock. But this isn&#39;t just any old model ship ...it&#39;s the Unicorn. Built by one of Haddock&#39;s ancestors it holds a clue to finding the treasure of a notorious pirate. The Adventures of Tintin are among the best books for readers aged 8 and up. Herge (Georges Remi) was born in Brussels in 1907. Over the course of 54 years he completed over 20 titles in The Adventures of Tintin series, which is now considered to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, comics series of all time.

When Tintin finds a magnificent model ship in the street market, his attempt to buy it for Captain Haddock leads him on a trail of pickpockets, burglars, and secret treasure, and Haddock enthralls him with a tale of his seafaring ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock (who was exclaiming "Thundering typhoons!" generations before the Captain ever did), and his fateful encounter with the fearsome pirate Red Rackham. The story is also notable for Herge's fantastic eye for ship detail as well as the first appearances of Nestor and Marlinspike Hall. <i>The Secret of the Unicorn</i> was Tintin's first official two-book adventure, continued in <i>Red Rackham's Treasure</i>. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>Herge (Georges Remi) was born in Brussels in 1907. Over the course of 54 years he completed 23 albums of The Adventures of Tintin series, which is now considered to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, comics series of all time. With translations published in over 80 languages, more than 230 million copies sold worldwide and a Hollywood movie to its name, Tintin dominates the Comics and Graphic Novels chart even today. Sadly, Herge died in 1983, leaving his 24th album, Tintin and Alph-Art, unfinished, but his hero continues to be one of the most iconic characters in both adult and children&#39;s fiction.</p><h2>Public Relations Writing: Form &amp; Style</h2><p>PUBLIC RELATIONS WRITING: FORM AND STYLE combines the practical approach of a trade book with the fundamental principles and theories of Public Relations to provide you with the essential techniques and methods needed to write with understanding and purpose This text guides you through a logical progression of PR writing, starting with an explanation of how this kind of writing is unique and by exploring the legal and ethical obligations.

This user-friendly guide introduces PECS, a simple and empowering communication tool in which partners exchange cards with photos or line drawings representing objects, attributes, and actions. A child or adult who has delayed or no speech can easily express his basic desires (e.g., &#39;&#39;ice cream&#39;&#39;) or needs using a PECS card without prompting from another. And as a person&#39;s PECS usage progresses, he or she learns to put pictures together in sentences to express desires (e.g., &#39;&#39;I want chocolate ice cream.&#39;&#39;), to comment, and to ask questions. A Picture&#39;s Worth examines verbal communication development and how autism affects these skills, and shows how a child&#39;s poor communication skills can lead to problem behaviors. Providing communication options--PECS and the other augmentative and alternative communication strategies (AAC) described in the book--reduces frustration and enhances learning. This new edition cites research that proves PECS (and other AAC strategies) doesn&#39;t interfere with the development of speaking skills, and actually can provide a boost to the acquisition of these skills. There&#39;s also expanded information on: -Deciding whether a child needs AAC and could benefit from PECS -Who is an appropriate candidate for PECS -Error correction strategies during the initial stages of PECS -How to choose challenging behaviors to try to eliminate -What to do when a child does not look at pictures Thousands of people with autism and other disabilities have benefited from using PECS.

Beginning from this intriguing premise, <i>The Winemaker's Dance </i>embarks on an eye-opening exploration of "terroir" in one of the greatest places on earth to grow wine&#x2015;California's Napa Valley. Jonathan Swinchatt and David G. Howell weave a tale that begins millions of years ago with the clash of continental plates that created the Napa Valley and go on to show how this small region, with its myriad microclimates, complex geologic history, and dedicated winemakers, came to produce world-class wines. A fascinating look at the art and science of winemaking and the only comprehensive book that covers Napa's geology, history, and environment, <i>The Winemaker's Dance </i>will help wine enthusiasts better understand wine talk and wine writing and, most importantly, wine itself. <br><br><i>The Winemaker's Dance </i>is animated by the voices of Napa's winemakers talking about their craft. The book also contains two driving tours through the valley that highlight the landscapes and wineries discussed. An array of unique illustrations&#x2015;including shaded relief maps overlaid with color aerial photographs&#x2015;provide a new and illuminating look at the region: its bedrock, sediments, soils, sun, wind, and rain. The expansive narrative considers how these elements influence wines from particular vineyards and how specific winemaking practices can bring out or mask aspects of terroir. It concludes with a discussion of the state of the winemaking industry today. <br><br>Unraveling the complex relationship between the people, the earth, and the vines of Napa Valley, <i>The Winemaker's Dance </i>brings the elusive concept of terroir to a broad audience, adding a vibrant dimension to the experience of the valley's wines. It also provides insights that enhance our understanding of wines and winegrowing regions the world over.</p><p>&#x201c;This beautifully written and illustrated account of Napa's landforms, their history, and their relation to winemaking blends real science with a very special culture.

Foods, drinks, and supplements are loaded with extra protein. Many people use protein for weight control, to gain or lose pounds, while others believe it gives them more energy and is essential for a longer, healthier life. Now, Dr. Garth Davis, an expert in weight loss asks, &#x201c;Is all this protein making us healthier?&#x201d;</p><p>The answer, he emphatically argues, is NO. Too much protein is actually making us sick, fat, and tired, according to Dr. Davis. If you are getting adequate calories in your diet, there is no such thing as protein deficiency. The healthiest countries in the world eat far less protein than we do and yet we have an entire nation on a protein binge getting sicker by the day.</p><p>As a surgeon treating obese patients, Dr. Davis was frustrated by the ever-increasing number of sick and overweight patients, but it wasn't until his own health scare that he realized he could do something about it. Combining cutting-edge research, with his hands-on patient experience and his years dedicated to analyzing studies of the world&#x2019;s longest-lived populations, this explosive, groundbreaking book reveals the truth about the dangers of protein and shares a proven approach to weight loss, health, and longevity.</p></p><p><p>Cut Through the Noise.

Holliday frames the gold rush years within the larger story of the state's transformation from the quietude of a Mexican hinterland in the 1840s to the forefront of entrepreneurial capitalism by the 1890s. No other state, no nation experienced such an adolescence of freedom and success. By 1883 California was hailed as "America, only more so."<br><br>Holliday's boldly interpretive narrative has the authority and immediacy of an eyewitness account. This eminent historian recreates the masculine world of mining camps and rough cities, where both business and pleasure were conducted far from hometown eyes and conventional inhibitions. He follows gold mining's swift evolution from treasure hunt to vast industry; traces the prodigal plunder of California's virgin rivers and abundant forests; and describes improvised feats of engineering, breathtaking in their scope and execution.<br><br>Holliday also conjures the ambitious, often ruthless Californians whose rush for riches rapidly changed the state: the Silver Kings of the Comstock Lode, the timber barons of the Sierra forests, the Big Four who built the first transcontinental railroad, and the lesser profit-seekers who owned steamboats, pack mules, gambling dens and bordellos&#x2014;and, most important for California's future, the farmers who prospered by feeding the rapidly growing population. This wildly laissez-faire economy created California's image as a risk-taking society, unconstrained by fear of failure.<br><br>The central theme of <i>Rush for Riches</i> is how, after decades of careless freedom, the miners were finally reined in by the farmers, and how their once mutually dependent relationship soured into hostility. This potential violence led to a dramatic courtroom decision in 1884 that shut down the mighty hydraulic mining operations&#x2014;the end of California's free-for-all youthful exuberance.<br><br>Unique in its format, this beautiful book offers not only a compelling narrative but also almost two hundred fifty illustrations, one hundred in full color, that richly illuminate the themes and details of the text: daguerreotypes, photographs, paintings, lithographs, sketches, and specially drawn maps.<br><br><i>Los Angeles Times Best Nonfiction Book of 2000</i></p><p>"J.S.

The choices are sometimes stark: trade-offs between roads and schools, public safety and health care. The new edition of Governing States and Localities responds to this reality with a new, sharper focus on economic and budget pressures. The chapter on finances comes earlier in the book, helping to frame each of the subsequent issues, and a new feature called &#34;States under Stress&#34; helps students see how fiscal and budgetary policy affects all areas of state and local governance. A brand-new chapter on the environment highlights the leadership role the states have taken in fighting climate change, creating green jobs, and combating pollution. Still a great blend of engaging journalistic writing, high-quality academic analysis, and the latest scholarship, the third edition has been thoroughly updated to account for such major developments as the recentralization of federalism under the Obama administration and the further politicization and rising costs of judicial elections. The authors have expanded coverage of referendums and direct democracy, as well as the increased role states play in homeland security. A series of well-designed features asks students to apply the comparative method (&#34;A Difference that Makes a Difference&#34;), to see how intergovernmental relations impact localities (&#34;Local Focus&#34;), and to see examples of how policies are actually implemented (&#34;Policy in Practice&#34;). An engaging full-color design, more than thirty maps, a vivid selection of photographs, updated tables and figures, and a marginal glossary all combine to keep your students focused and learning.</p><p><p><b>Kevin B.

I use the test bank for tests and quizzes, and find much of this essential to my course. I have used this book since its first edition, and plan on keeping it. It is the third state and local book I have used, and it is the best of the bunch. --Lisa Langenbach, Middle Tennessee State University<br><br><i>Governing States and Localities</i> seems to be more entertaining than competing texts. In other words, it keeps the student's attention with a more illustrative style. The real world examples and stories throughout the book are very good.

It uses the language and notation of vectors and matrices to clarify issues in multivariable calculus, and combines a clear and expansive writing style with an interesting selection of material. Chapter topics cover vectors, differentiation in several variables, vector-valued functions, maxima and minima in several variables, multiple integration, line integrals, surface integrals and vector analysis, and vector analysis in higher dimensions. For individuals interested in math and calculus.</p><p><p> <b><i>Susan Coney</i></b> is currently the Andrew and Pauline Delaney Professor of Mathematics at Oberlin College, having previously served as Chair of the Department. </p> <p> She received S.B. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology prior to joining the faculty at Oberlin in 1983. </p> <p> Her research focuses on enumerative problems in algebraic geometry, particularly concerning multiple-point singularities and higher-order contact of plane curves. </p> <p> Professor Coney has published papers on algebraic geometry as well as articles on other mathematical subjects. She has lectured internationally on her research and has taught a wide range of subjects in undergraduate mathematics. </p> <p> Professor Coney is a member of several professional and honorary societies, including the American Mathematical Society, the Mathematical Association of America, Phi Beta Kappa, and Sigma Xi. </p><p> Physical and natural phenomena depend on a complex array of factors. The sociologist or psychologist who studies group behavior, the economist who endeavors to understand the vagaries of a nation's employment cycles, the physicist who observes the trajectory of a particle or planet, or indeed anyone who seeks to understand geometry in two, three, or more dimensions recognizes the need to analyze changing quantities that depend on more than a single variable. Vector calculus is the essential mathematical tool for such analysis. Moreover, it is an exciting and beautiful subject in its own right, a true adventure in many dimensions. </p> <p> The only technical prerequisite for this text, which is intended for a sophomore-level course in multivariable calculus, is a standard course in the calculus of functions of one variable. In particular, the necessary matrix arithmetic and algebra (not linear algebra) are developed as needed. Although the mathematical background assumed is not exceptional, the reader will still need to "think hard" in places. </p> <p> My own objectives in writing the book are simple ones: to develop in students a sound conceptual grasp of vector calculus and to help them begin the transition from first-year calculus to more advanced technical mathematics. I maintain that the first goal can be met, at least in part, through the use of vector and matrix notation, so that many results, especially those of differential calculus, can be stated with reasonable levels of clarity and generality. Properly described, results in the calculus of several variables can look quite similar to those of the calculus of one variable. Reasoning by analogy will thus be an important pedagogical tool. I also believe that a conceptual understanding of mathematics can be obtained through the development of a good geometric intuition. Although I state many results in the case of <i>n</i> variables (where <i>n</i> is arbitrary), I recognize that the most important and motivational examples usually arise for functions of two and three variables, so these concrete and visual situations are emphasized to explicate the general theory. Vector calculus is in many ways an ideal subject for students to begin exploration of the interrelations among analysis, geometry, and matrix algebra. </p> <p> Multivariable calculus, for many students, represents the beginning of significant mathematical maturation. Consequently, I have written a rather expansive text so that they can see that there is a "story" behind the results, techniques, and examples&#x2014;that the subject coheres and that this coherence is important for problem solving. To indicate some of the power of the methods introduced, a number of topics, not always discussed very fully in a first multivariable calculus course, are treated here in some detail: </p> <ul> <li>an early introduction of cylindrical and spherical coordinates</li> <li>the use of vector techniques to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion</li> <li>the elementary differential geometry of curves in <b>R</b>3, including discussion of curvature, torsion, and the Frenet-Serret formulas for the moving frame</li> <li>Taylor's formula for functions of several variables</li> <li>the use of the Hessian matrix to determine the nature (as local extrema) of critical points of functions of <i>n</i> variables</li> <li>an extended discussion of the change of variables formula in double and triple integrals</li> <li>applications of vector analysis to physics</li> <li>an introduction to differential forms and the generalized Stokes's theorem</li> </ul> <p> Included are a number of proofs of important results. The more technical proofs are collected as addenda at the end of the appropriate sections so as not to disrupt the main conceptual flow and to allow for greater flexibility of use by the instructor and student. Nonetheless, some proofs (or sketches of proofs) embody such central ideas that they are included in the main body of the text. </p> <p><b>New in the Second Edition</b></p> <p> I have retained the overall structure and tone of the first edition. New features include the following: </p> <ul> <li>220 new exercises of varying levels of difficulty;</li> <li>70 computer-based exercises;</li> <li>a new chapter (Chapter 8) on differential forms, parametrized manifolds, and the generalized Stokes's theorem that significantly expands on the first edition;</li> <li>an expanded discussion of the implicit function and inverse function theorems</li> <li>an expanded discussion of quadratic forms and their role in determining extrema of functions</li> <li>various refinements throughout the text, including new examples and explanations.</li> </ul> <p><b>How To Use This Book</b></p> <p> There is more material in this book than can be covered comfortably during a single semester. Hence, the instructor will wish to eliminate some topics or subtopics&#x2014;or to abbreviate the rather leisurely presentations of limits and differentiability. Since I frequently find myself without the time to treat surface integrals in detail, I have separated all material concerning parametrized surfaces, surface integrals, and Stokes's and Gauss's theorems (Chapter 7), from that concerning line integrals and Green's theorem (Chapter 6). In particular, in a one-semester course for students with little or no experience with vectors or matrices, instructors can probably expect to cover most of the material in Chapters 1-6, although no doubt it will be necessary to omit some of the optional subsections and to downplay many of the proofs of results. A rough outline for such a course, allowing for some instructor discretion, could be the following: </p> <b>Chapter 1:</b> 8-9 lectures<br> <b>Chapter 2:</b> 9 lectures<br> <b>Chapter 3:</b> 4-5 lectures<br> <b>Chapter 4:</b> 5-6 lectures<br> <b>Chapter 5:</b> 8 lectures<br> <b>Chapter 6:</b> 4 lectures<br> <b>Total:</b> 38-41 lectures <p></p> <p> If students have a richer background (so that much of the material in Chapter 1 can be left largely to them to read on their own), then it should be possible to treat a good portion of Chapter 7 as well. For a two-quarter or two-semester course, it should be possible to work through the entire book with reasonable care and rigor, although coverage of Chapter 8 should depend on students' exposure to introductory linear algebra, as somewhat more sophistication is assumed there. </p> <p> The exercises vary from relatively routine computations to more challenging and provocative problems, generally (but not invariably) increasing in difficulty for each section. Each chapter concludes with a set of miscellaneous exercises that review and extend the ideas introduced in the chapter, and occasionally present new applications. </p> <p> A word about the use of technology. The text was written without reference to any particular computer software or graphing calculator. Most of the exercises can be solved by hand, although there is no reason not to turn over some of the more tedious calculations to a computer. Those exercises that <i>require</i> a computer for computational or graphical purposes are marked with a computer symbol, and should be amenable to software such as <i>Mathematica</i>�, Maple�, or MATLAB. </p></p><h2>Latin for Local History: An Introduction (Longman Paperback)</h2><p><i>Latin for Local History </i>provides a self-teaching guide for those historians who wish to tackle the language in which the majority of pre-eighteenth century historical records have been written.

In his enduringly popular masterpiece <i>The Screwtape Letters,</i> C. S. Lewis re-imagines Hell as a gruesome bureaucracy. With spiritual insight and wry wit, Lewis suggests that demons, laboring in a vast enterprise, have horribly recognizable human attributes: competition, greed, and totalitarian punishment. Avoiding their own painful torture as well as a desire to dominate are what drive demons to torment their &#x201c;patients.&#x201d; <br>The style and unique dark humor of <i>The Screwtape Letters </i>are retained in this full-cast dramatization, as is the original setting of London during World War II. The story is carried by the senior demon Screwtape played magnificently by award-winning actor Andy Serkis (&#x201c;Gollum&#x201d; in Lord of the Rings) as he shares correspondence to his apprentice demon Wormwood. All 31 letters lead into dramatic scenes, set in either Hell or the real world with humans&#x2015;aka &#x201c;the patient,&#x201d; as the demons say&#x2015;along with his circle of friends and family. This Radio Theatre release also stars Geoffrey Palmer (<i>Tomorrow Never Dies</i>), Laura Michelle Kelly (<i>Sweeney Todd</i>), Eileen Page (<i>The Secret Garden</i>), and other world-class actors. <br>Includes 10 new songs inspired by the classic book, four behind-the-scenes video documentary featurettes, and a 5.1 surround sound mix. Four CDs, approx. 4 hours total.</p><p>Master demon Screwtape, played by a marvelously diabolic Andy Serkis, can sound sympathetic, urbane, and ruthless (like the best of devils) all in a single breath when he offers a little advice to his nephew, Wormwood, regarding the temptation, persecution, and ultimate destruction of the human soul. In this clear and well-crafted dramatization of C.S. Lewis&#39;s 31 satirical letters, both story and moral journey are accentuated by the wonderful acting chemistry between Serkis, who voiced Gollum in THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and Bertie Carvel&#39;s deftly understated Wormwood. A superb supporting cast, sound effects, and music that re-creates the ambiance and gravitas of Lewis&#39;s war-torn 1940s England round out this intelligent production. This is audio theater at its best. B.P.

In addition to becoming bestsellers in their own right, memoirs have become a popular object of inquiry in the academy and a mainstay in most M.F.A. workshops. Courses in what is now called &#34;life writing&#34; study memoir alongside personal essays, diaries, and autobiographies. Memoir: An Introduction proffers a succinct and comprehensive survey of the genre (and its many subgenres) while taking readers through the various techniques, themes, and debates that have come to characterize the ubiquitous literary form. Its fictional origins are traced to eighteenth-century British novels; its early American roots are examined in Benjamin Franklin&#39;s Autobiography and colonial captivity narratives; and its ethical conundrums are considered via the imbroglios brought on by the questionable claims in Rigoberta Mench�&#39;s I, Rigoberta, and more notoriously, James Frey&#39;s A Million Little Pieces. Alongside these more traditional literary forms, Couser expands the discussion of memoir to include film with what he calls &#34;documemoir&#34; (exemplified in Nathaniel Kahn&#39;s My Architect) and graphic narratives like Art Spiegelman&#39;s Maus.</p><p><br><strong>G.

An important feature of the book is the large number of articles on "topics of mental life", in which well-known writers discuss subjects in which they have a particular expertise. Noam Chomsky writes on his own theory of language, Idries Shah on Sufism, John Bowlby on attachment theory, B.F. Skinner on behaviorism, Oliver Sacks on nothingness, A.J. Ayer on philosophical views of the relation between mind and body, and R.D. Laing on interpersonal experience. The editor, Richard Gregory, contributes entries on aesthetics, phrenology, physiognomy, and illusions of perception.<br> The <em>Companion</em> includes entries on such everyday events as sleep, humor, forgetting, and hearing, as well as specialized topics such as bilingualism, jet-lag, military incompetence, computer chess, and animal magnetism. What can, and all too often does, go wrong with the mind is also covered--many forms of mental illness are explored, as well as mental handicap, brain damage, and neurological disorders. Perception and the ways in which our senses are often deceived are treated in full, as are elements of personal development and learning, and the puzzling world of parapsychology with its altered states of consciousness, out-of-body experiences, and extra-sensory perception. The workings of the nervous system are explained in a special tutorial article.<br> The text is supplemented by brief definitions of specialist terms and by biographies of major figures who have contributed to our understanding of the mind--individuals as varied as Plato, Johannes Kepler, William James, Sigmund Freud, and Alan Turing. The entries are arranged alphabetically and, following the style of other recent <em>Companions</em>, are linked by a network of helpful cross-references. The 160 illustrations have been carefully chosen to amplify the text, while specialist bibliographies provide suggestions for further reading.</p><p>A field of 216 contributors filled this tome with savory items from Abacus to Zeno of Elea. In between there are 819 pages of 1001 entries, all in some way expanding our understanding of psychology, philosophy and the physiology of the brain. Like all excellent references, you could easily, happily get lost perusing, but it also happens to be excellently well indexed.

If God is all-powerful and all-loving, why is there so much evil in the world? John Stackhouse takes a historically informed approach to this dilemma, examining what philosophers and theologians have said on the subject and offering reassuring answers for thoughtful readers.<br> Stackhouse explores how great thinkers have grappled with the problem of evil--from the Buddha, Confucius, Augustine, and David Hume to Martin Luther, C. S. Lewis, and Alvin Plantinga. Without brushing aside the serious contradictions posed by a God who allows incurable diseases, natural disasters, and senseless crimes to bring misery into our lives, Stackhouse asks if a world completely without evil is what we truly want. Would a life without suffering be a meaningful life? Could free will exist if we were able to choose only good? Stackhouse examines what the best minds have had to say on these questions and boldly affirms that the benefits of evil, in fact, outweigh the costs. Finally, he points to Christian revelation--which promises the transformation of suffering into joy--as the best guide to God's<br></p><p><br><strong>John G. Stackhouse</strong>, Jr., is Professor of Religious Studies at Crandall University in New Brunswick, Canada.<br>"Stackhouse succumbs neither to skepticism nor to pious cliche. Here is an author who has heard our cry from the depths and who joins us in wondering if God has heard it too. This wise and illuminating book belongs not on the shelf, but on the desk, of anyone who cares about humanity's oldest<br>question."--Cornelius Plantinga, Jr., Dean of the Chapel, Calvin College, Professor of Systematic Theology, Calvin Theological Seminary<br><br>"John Stackhouse does not attempt to `solve' the problem of pain and evil in this book. Rather, he reduces the tangled issue to one fundamental question--Is God trustworthy?--and offers a careful, wise, and well-argued answer."--Phillip Yancey, author of Disappointment with God and The Jesus I<br>Never Knew<br><br>"John Stackhouse has written a candid, accessible, humane and impressively informed discussion about reasons to trust the Christian God in a world of sorrows and pain. He sets the Christian understanding of these things within the context of other world religions, treating them respectfully<br>and noting Christian particularities. There is much learning worn lightly here, and much humility and human authenticity as well."--L. W. Hurtado, University of Edinburgh<br><br>"Can God Be Trusted? is intended to be practical, not esoteric, informative, not preachy, and in that it succeeds.... His approach is measured, reasonable and, considering how much philosophical and historic ground he has to cover, surprisingly comprehensive."--Ottawa Citizen<br><br>"Stackhouse has succeeded admirably in producing a broadly accessible work that is religiously sensitive and offers for the reader a reasonable argument that it is rational to trust God even in the glaring face of evil."--First Things</p><h2>Evan-Moor Daily Language Review, Grade 8 Actvities Homeschooling &amp; Classroom Resource Workbook, Reproducible Worksheets, Teacher Edition, Daily Practice, Skills Accessment, Grammar, Punctuation</h2><p>Eighth graders will be able to gain a firm grasp on grammar and word usage when they work on the Evan-Moor Daily Language Review Grade 8 Teacher s Edition workbook each day.

Butler relates the French and American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, the expansion of agriculture, trade, and industry, and growing economic and social pressures to the cultural forces which shaped their work. She reveals the common factors which engaged the separate efforts of so many individual creative minds, and the fierce personal and artistic politics of an age in the midst of profound change. Demonstrating that the literature produced during this dynamic, restless time is not as homogenous as is generally assumed, Butler illuminates the ways in which these various experimental works reflected radically new sensibilities and aspirations.<br></p><p>Marilyn Butler is King Edward VII Professor of English Literature at Cambridge University. She is also the author of Jane Austen and the War of Ideas (Clarendon Press, 1975), Maria Edgeworth: A Literary Biography (Clarendon Press, 1972), Burke, Paine, Godwin and the Revolution Controversy<br>(ed.) (CUP, 1984), and a biography of Peacock.Mrs. Butler has a wide range of critical and human sympathy.

This book includes essential and detailed information on relevant film and digital video tools, a thorough overview of the filmmaking stages, and the aesthetic considerations for telling a visual story.<br><br>The ultimate goal of this book is to help you develop your creative voice while acquiring the solid practical skills and confidence to use it. Unlike many books that privilege raw technical information or the line-producing aspects of production, Voice &amp; Vision places creativity, visual expression, and cinematic ideas front and center. After all, every practical decision a filmmaker makes, like choosing a location, an actor, a film stock, a focal length, a lighting set-up, an edit point, or a sound effect is also an expressive one and should serve the filmmaker's vision. Every decision, from the largest conceptual choices to the smallest practical solutions, has a profound impact on what appears on the screen and how it moves an audience.<br><br> "In Practice&#x201d; sidebars throughout Voice &amp; Vision connect conceptual, aesthetic and technical issues to their application in the real world. Some provide a brief analysis of a scene or technique from easily rentable films which illustrate how a specific technology or process is used to support a conceptual, narrative, or aesthetic choice. Others recount common production challenges encountered on real student and professional shoots which will inspire you to be innovative and resourceful when you are solving your own filmmaking challenges. <br><br>Other features in Voice &amp; Vision include:<br>* Comprehensive technical information on film and digital video production with a focus on low-budget techniques and creative expression<br>* Close to 600 lavish illustrations<br>* A seamless integration of film and digital video. Express yourself with any camera and any format.<br>* A focus on successful filmmaking within limitations, learn to work successfully with available resources (time, equipment, budget, personnel) and turn limitations into opportunities.<br>* A substantial exploration of the sound tools and techniques used in film production and the creative impact of the post-production sound design.</p><p>Mick Hurbis-Cherrier has been teaching all levels of film and video production at Hunter College in New York City for more than a decade. He works professionally in both film and video and has performed a wide range of duties on films, including producing, writing, directing, cinematography, and editing. His films and videos have been shown around the country and have garnered prizes in many festivals.<p></p><p>"For those filmmakers who want to learn more about the technicalities of film and DV production, this is the book you've been waiting for. Written in a way that is educational yet easy-to-understand, you will find this book helpful whether you're a new filmmaker or one with some experience under your belt. Regardless of your budget size, or your preference for film/DV, there is an incredible amount of information to learn here. The book's layout and detailed illustrations make it easy to follow and enjoyable to read, while the depth of information--as well as the topics themselves--ensure that this book will be usable for quite awhile after its purchase. The price is excellent, espcially considering the amount of information the book contains, as well as its reusability. A must-have for the filmmaker who wants to take his education to the next level!" - Microfilmmaker Magazine "I've adopted the textbook for my film production class and I have to tell you I have not come across a better one. ... I'm continually thrilled when I discover yet another piece that is ideal for teaching not just the mechanics of film making, but the impact on cinematic storytelling. Too many textbooks leave out the 'why' when explaining production. It's easy to get sidetracked into explaining technical details, but unless you can explain its relevance to the story, why teach it?" -Hamp Overton, Assistant Professor - University of New Orleans "With Voice and Vision, Mick Hurbis-Cherrierhas written a ground-breaking book that approaches the subject as a technical, narrative, creative endeavor that marries a filmmaker's voice to his/her mise en scene. It is a book that is compelling and exciting as it distills essential information about film and digital image-making tools with the aesthetic wisdom of many of the world's greatest storytellers. It is quite simply the best book of its kind on the market today." - Film Festival Today "A concise, graphic, and comprehensive manual for the serious beginning filmmaker--full of practical, technical information and solid artistic guidance, and some inspiration too." -Michael Rabiger, Author of "Directing: Film Techniques and Aesthetics and Directing the Documentary" "Hurbis-Cherrier takes years of teaching film and video production and puts it all down on paper in 'Voice and Vision,' combining technical and aesthetic applications with a realistic approach to filmmaking. It is a comprehensive guide for aspiring filmmakers working in both film and digital video." -Jacqueline B. Frost, Associate Professor, Department of Radio-TV-Film, California State University, Fullerton "Mick Hurbis-Cherrier has written a very unusual book for film and video makers. The book,Voice and Vision,differs from other production books by seeing production as a technical,narrative,creative undertaking that is unique because each filmmaker has a distinct voice.This book transends 'how to' and invites the creative 'why-not' of its readers. I've never read a better beginning to the film and videomaking journey." -Ken Dancyger, Professor at New York University's Kanbar Institute of Film &amp; Television and Author of "Broadcast Writing," "Alternative Scriptwriting," "The Technique of Film and Video Editing" and "Writing the Short Film." "It feels like sitting in a classroom with a great teacher, who supplements key information with wonderfully entertaining and illustrative stories...students will feel more like they are reading a good story rather than trying to wade through a textbook." -Andrew Lund, Filmmaker and Graduate Film Professor, Columbia University "The discussion of the technical and logistic matters is very good: it is comprehensive, thorough, and very well explained." -Michael Kowalski, Film Professor, Chapman University, and Sound Designer on "Lost In La Mancha" "Mick Hurbis-Cherrier teaches film and video production at Hunter College in New York, and has worked as a producer, director, cinematographer and editor. He knows what he's talking about, and has presented it in a beautifully illustrated and photographed book that should be a required textbook in every film school.&#x201d;&nbsp; --Jon Fauer, ASC, Film and Digital Times</p> <p>"This text is not in the form of a technical manual to be shelved as a reference book but is instead a production bible and reader for those actively involved in filmmaking.

Called in its subtitle &#x201c;A Novel Without a Hero,&#x201d; <b>Vanity Fair </b>has instead two heroines: the faithful, loyal Amelia Sedley and the beautiful and scheming social climber Becky Sharp. It also engages a huge cast of wonderful supporting characters as the novel spins from Miss Pinkerton&#x2019;s academy for young ladies to affairs of love and war on the Continent to liaisons in the dazzling ballrooms of London. Thackeray&#x2019;s forte is the bon mot and it is amply exercised in a novel filled with memorably wicked lines. Lengthy and leisurely in pace, the novel follows the adventures of Becky and Amelia as their fortunes rise and fall, creating a tale of both picaresque and risqu�. Thackery mercilessly skewers his society, especially the upper class, poking fun at their shallow values and pointedly jabbing at their hypocritical &#x201c;morals.&#x201d; His weapons, however, are not fire and brimstone but an unerring eye for the absurd and a genius for observation of the foibles of his age. An enduring classic, this great novel is a brilliant study in duplicity and hypocrisy...and a mirror with which to view our own times.</p><p>After first appearing as a serial in brilliant yellow covers, Vanity Fair, &#39;a novel without a hero&#39;, was published in full in 1848. A panoramic and biting satire, it was the first of William Makepeace Thackeray&#39;s works to bear his own name. This edition includes his original illustrations and preface.<i>Vanity Fair</i> is a story of two heroines--one humber, the other scheming and social climbing--who meet inboarding school and embark on markedly different lives. Amid the swirl of London's posh ballrooms and affairs of love and war, their fortunes rise and fall. Through it all, Thackeray lampoons the shallow values of his society, reserving the most pointed barbs for the upper crust. What results is a prescient look at the dogged pursuit of wealth and status--and the need for humility.</p><h2>Ghost Of Winter (MechWarrior Series, #1)</h2><p>When his world is conquered by pirates, an untested MechWarrior is stranded in the frozen wastes, where he discovers a long-hidden secret that could make him a hero of his people</p><p><b>Mel Odom</b> is a novelist who mostly writes in the fantasy, science-fiction, and action-adventure genres.

Taking into account that feminism has altered the dynamic between the sexes, Farrell claims that in their relationships both sexes would like to &#34;have it all,&#34; but that their realities and fantasies diverge widely fantasies that, he contends, are exploited by advertising, magazines, romance novels, movies and TV, working at both conscious and unconscious levels. These media intensify men&#39;s compulsion to perform in sports, at sex and on the job, often masking deep insecurity and vulnerability,</p><p>Another book for women about men, this attempt at psychological/sociological exploration generalizes about relations between white, urban, middle-class men and women. Blaming socialization and stereotypic sex roles for the inability of men to relate to women, the author maintains that "only when a woman shares male risks can she really begin to understand men." Farrell uses cartoons, advertisements, personal and fictional anecdotes, references to movies, but few hard facts to substantiate his simplistic hypotheses. Often appealing, occasionally insightful, sometimes misguided, this sincere attempt to deescalate the war between the sexes has relatively little to offer.James E. Van Buskirk, Acad. of Art Coll.

The book identifies the social tensions and political inconsistencies that spurred radical change in the government of Russia, from the turn of the century to the revolution of 1917. Kenez envisions that revolution as a crisis of authority that posed the question, &#39;Who shall govern Russia?&#39; This question was resolved with the creation of the Soviet Union. Kenez traces the development of the Soviet Union from the Revolution, through the 1920s, the years of the New Economic Policies and into the Stalinist order. He shows how post-Stalin Soviet leaders struggled to find ways to rule the country without using Stalin&#39;s methods but also without openly repudiating the past, and to negotiate a peaceful but antipathetic coexistence with the capitalist West. In this second edition, he also examines the post-Soviet period, tracing Russia&#39;s development up to the time of publication.</p><p>An examination of political, social and cultural developments in the Soviet Union.

His major works include the Houston Museum of Fine Art, Davis Art Museum at Wellesley College, the Stockholm Museum of Modern Art and Architecture, and the Potzdammer Platz Hotel in Berlin. Now Moneo will be known as a daring critic as well. In this book, he looks at eight of his contemporaries&#x2015;all architects of international stature&#x2015;and discusses the theoretical positions, technical innovations, and design contributions of each. Moneo's discussion of these eight architects&#x2015;James Stirling, Robert Venturi, Aldo Rossi, Peter Eisenman, Alvaro Siza, Frank Gehry, Rem Koolhaas, and the partnership of Jacques Herzog and Pierre De Meuron&#x2015;has the colloquial, engaging tone of a series of lectures on modern architecture by a master architect; the reader hears not the dispassionate theorizing of an academic, but Moneo's own deeply held convictions as he considers the work of his contemporaries. More than 500 illustrations accompany the text.</p><p>Discussing each of the eight architects in turn, Moneo first gives an introductory profile, emphasizing intentions, theoretical concerns, and construction procedures. He then turns to the work, offering detailed critical analyses of the works he considers to be crucial for an informed understanding of this architect's work. The many images he uses to illustrate his points resemble the rapid-fire flash of slides in a lecture, but Moneo's perspective is unique among lecturers. These profiles are not what Moneo calls the "tacit treatises" that can be found on the shelves of a university library, but lively encounters of architectural equals.</p></p><p>Jos� Rafael Moneo is an internationally renowned architect, in practice since 1965.

It compares societies over time and across environments, emphasizing the dynamics of social change. Its clearly developed ecological-evolutionary perspective provides a powerful theoretical framework for understanding the array of social arrangements found in human societies over the past 100,000 years. Since industrial societies are introduced only after this theoretical base has been firmly established and older, simpler, and smaller societies have been examined in detail, students see their own society (and other contemporary societies) in a broader and more meaningful way. By showing how social arrangements are related to the environmental and technological contexts that societies are situated in, <em>Human</em> <em>Societies </em>encourages students to look for the reasons why social arrangements are the way they are, and why they change over time.<br></p><p><br><strong>Patrick Nolan</strong> is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the University of South Carolina.

This first edition credited the work's fictional protagonist Robinson Crusoe as its author, leading many readers to believe he was a real person and the book a travelogue of true incidents. It was published under the considerably longer original title The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, Of York, Mariner: Who lived Eight and Twenty Years, all alone in an un-inhabited Island on the Coast of America, near the Mouth of the Great River of Oroonoque; Having been cast on Shore by Shipwreck, wherein all the Men perished but himself. With An Account how he was at last as strangely deliver'd by Pyrates. Epistolary, confessional, and didactic in form, the book is a fictional autobiography of the title character (whose birth name is Robinson Kreutznaer)&#x2014;a castaway who spends years on a remote tropical island near Trinidad, encountering cannibals, captives, and mutineers before being rescued.The story is widely perceived to have been influenced by the life of Alexander Selkirk, a Scottish castaway who lived for four years on the Pacific island called "M�s a Tierra" (in 1966 its name was changed to Robinson Crusoe Island), Chile. However, other possible sources have been put forward for the text. It is possible, for example, that Defoe was inspired by the Latin or English translations of Ibn Tufail's Hayy ibn Yaqdhan, an earlier novel also set on a desert island. Another source for Defoe's novel may have been Robert Knox's account of his abduction by the King of Ceylon in 1659 in "An Historical Account of the Island Ceylon," Glasgow: James MacLehose and Sons (Publishers to the University), 1911.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.This classic story of a shipwrecked mariner on a deserted island is perhaps the greatest adventure in all of English literature. Fleeing from pirates, Robinson Crusoe is swept ashore in a storm possessing only a knife, a box of tobacco, a pipe-and the will to survive. His is the saga of a man alone: a man who overcomes self-pity and despair to reconstruct his life; who painstakingly teaches himself how to fashion a pot, bake bread, build a canoe; and who, after twenty-four agonizing years of solitude, discovers a human footprint in the sand... Consistently popular since its first publication in 1719, Daniel Defoe's story of human endurance in an exotic, faraway land exerts a timeless appeal. The first important English novel, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> has taken its rightful place among the great myths of Western civilization.</p><h2>Teaching Hamlet and Henry IV, Part 1: Shakespeare Set Free (Folger Shakespeare Library)</h2><p><p> <b>FOLGER Shakespeare Library</b> </p><p> <b>THE WORLD'S LEADING CENTER FOR SHAKESPEARE STUDIES</b> </p><p> The Folger Shakespeare Library is one of the world's leading centers for scholarship, learning, and culture.

This edition of Class, Race, Gender, and Crime is the epitome of a great text for not only students of criminal justice or criminology but all who are interested in the 'justness' of the criminal justice system. This revised and updated version has again systematically outlined the core issues and the complexity of class, race, and gender&#x2014;and the importance of the interrelatedness of these concepts. The objectiveness of the text works to transform readers into critical consumers of knowledge. That is instrumental in higher learning, and this text has captured that critical objective. This edition has propelled this book to rank as one of the best texts written on the issue of class, race, gender, and crime in the fields of criminal justice, criminology, and justice studies. (Denise D. Nation, Winston-Salem State University)<br><br>The authors have revised and updated their excellent critical exploration of the impact of class, race, and gender on criminal justice practice in the United States. As with the earlier editions, written in clear, lively, jargon-free language, the book is an excellent text for students of criminal justice or criminology at all levels. No one can read this text without realizing the depth and complexity of the problems that face those who would make our criminal justice system truly a system of justice. (Jeffrey Reiman, American University; coauthor of The Rich Get Richer and the Poor Get Prison)<br><br>The authors once again demonstrate how class, race, gender, and crime-four explosive topics we're reluctant to talk about publicly-are interrelated and, more important, how these issues affect each and every one of us. For the authors, 'class' is not shorthand for the poor but includes the middle and upper class; 'gender' is not shorthand for women but includes men; 'race' is not shorthand for minorities but includes whites; and 'crime' is not shorthand for street crime but includes the crimes of the rich and powerful. Enlightening, sobering, and ultimately essential reading. This is admirable work. (Katheryn Russell-Brown, University of Florida)</p><h2>Celtic Mythology: Tales of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes</h2><p>Most people have heard of the Celts--the elusive, ancient tribal people who resided in present-day England, Ireland, Scotland and France. Paradoxically characterized as both barbaric and innocent, the Celts appeal to the modern world as a symbol of a bygone era, a world destroyed by the ambition of empire and the spread of Christianity throughout Western Europe. Despite the pervasive cultural and literary influence of the Celts, shockingly little is known of their way of life and beliefs, because very few records of their stories exist. In this book, for the first time, Philip Freeman brings together the best stories of Celtic mythology.<br><br>Everyone today knows about the gods and heroes of the ancient Greeks, such as Zeus, Hera, and Hercules, but how many people have heard of the Gaulish god Lugus or the magical Welsh queen Rhiannon or the great Irish warrior C Chulainn? We still thrill to the story of the Trojan War, but the epic battles of the Irish <em>Tin B Cuailgne</em> are known only to a few. And yet those who have read the stories of Celtic myth and legend-among them writers like J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis-have been deeply moved and influenced by these amazing tales, for there is nothing in the world quite like them. In these stories a mysterious and invisible realm of gods and spirits exists alongside and sometimes crosses over into our own human world; fierce women warriors battle with kings and heroes, and even the rules of time and space can be suspended. Captured in vivid prose these shadowy figures-gods, goddesses, and heroes-come to life for the modern reader.<br></p><p><br><strong>Philip Freeman</strong> graduated with a BA in Classics from the University of Texas and earned the first joint Ph.D. in Classics and Celtic Studies at Harvard University. He has been a college professor for twenty years teaching classical and Celtic mythology. He is the author of eighteen books and currently hold the Orlando W. Qualley Chair in Classics at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa.<br><br>"Freeman s <em>Celtic Mythology</em> is a satisfying presentation of a decent selection of Irish and Welsh myths and tales from both pagan and Christian sources...the Oxford hardback is smallish and well-designed. The introductions are short and sweet, as are the endnotes, and since Irish and Welsh names are tricky, a glossary is provided. This would be an excellent collection for introductory courses in Celtic Studies; it is also an entry point for anyone wanting to become familiar with these tales. Freeman's version is engaging, accessible, and faithful."--<em>Reading Religion</em><p></p><br>"Philip Freeman's book is a delight. This spirited retelling of the famous stories of the Celtic west serves as a brilliant introduction to the beliefs and values of the pagan and early Christian communities of Ireland and Wales. I can think of no better way to begin to explore the culture of the early Irish and Welsh." --Barry Cunliffe, author of <em>Britain Begins</em> <br><p></p><br>"Philip Freeman brings to life the tales the ancient Celts told to each other, and what tales they were! Filled with passion, rage, bravery, and adventure, these stories are as exciting today as they were on the dark nights of the distant past. Heroes, heroines, gods and goddesses come to life in Philip Freeman's brilliant re-telling of these little-known but unforgettable stories." --Terry Golway, author of <em>The Irish in America</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Criminology: A Sociological Understanding</h2><p><p> <i>Taking a sociological perspective, this book offers award-winning coverage of criminology and highlights issues of race, ethnicity, gender and social class throughout.</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <b> <i> <b>Criminology: A Sociological Understanding,</b> </i> 6e,</b> provides a sociological perspective on crime and criminal justice by treating social structure and social inequality as central themes in the study of crime&#x2014;and major factors in society's treatment of criminals. It gives explicit attention to key sociological concepts such as poverty, gender, race, and ethnicity, and demonstrates their influence on crime. Moving beyond simple &#x201c;get tough&#x201d; approaches, the book emphasizes the need to understand social causes of criminal behavior in order to significantly reduce it. This sixth edition continues to include certain chapters that remain uncommon in other criminology texts, including Chapter 2: Public Opinion, the News Media, and the Crime Problem; Chapter 11: Violence Against Women; Chapter 14: Political Crime; and Chapter 18: Conclusion: How Can We Reduce Crime? In addition, the book&#x2019;s criminal justice chapters, Chapter 16 (Policing: Dilemmas of Crime Control in a Democratic Society) and Chapter 17 (Prosecution and Punishment), continue to address two central themes in the sociological understanding of crime and criminal justice: (1) the degree to which race and ethnicity, gender, and social class affect the operation of the criminal justice system; and (2) the extent to which reliance on the criminal justice system can reduce the amount of crime.

In particular, Roosevelt trained his famous charm on Stalin, lavishing respect on him, salving his insecurities, and rendering him more amenable to compromise on some matters.</p><br><p> Yet, even as he pursued a lasting peace, FDR was alienating his own intimate circle of advisers and becoming dangerously isolated. After his death, postwar cooperation depended on Harry Truman, who, with very different sensibilities, heeded the embittered "Soviet experts" his predecessor had kept distant. A Grand Alliance was painstakingly built and carelessly lost. The Cold War was by no means inevitable.</p><br><p> This landmark study brings to light key overlooked documents, such as the Yalta diary of Roosevelt's daughter Anna; the intimate letters of Roosevelt's de facto chief of staff, Missy LeHand; and the wiretap transcripts of estranged adviser Harry Hopkins. With a gripping narrative and subtle analysis, <i>Roosevelt's Lost Alliances</i> lays out a new approach to foreign relations history. Frank Costigliola highlights the interplay between national political interests and more contingent factors, such as the personalities of leaders and the culturally conditioned emotions forming their perceptions and driving their actions. Foreign relations flowed from personal politics--a lesson pertinent to historians, diplomats, and citizens alike.</p></p><p><p>"This is a delightful and innovative book. Never before has any book on U.S. foreign relations provided such insightful character sketches. Scholars have long pondered why the best and the brightest went wrong, and now Costigliola offers an explanation: superpower tensions involved more than just misperceptions, divergent ideologies, and grand strategic differences. Personal rivalries, efforts to be in FDR's good graces, parties, and sex of all sort really had a bearing on diplomacy. Costigliola has written a novel masterpiece."<b>--Thomas W. Zeiler, University of Colorado at Boulder</b></p><p>"Costigliola pulls back the veil on the personal lives of the major figures of World War II. With great verve and captivating anecdotes, he shows how personal politics helped forge and disrupt international alliances. <i>Roosevelt's Lost Alliances</i> combines innovative research, provocative interpretations, and page-turning prose, providing a fresh take on how gender, emotion, class, and culture shaped the high politics of World War II and the Cold War."<b>--Emily S. Rosenberg, University of California, Irvine</b></p><p>"In this imaginative examination of the personal dynamics of the Big Three alliance during World War II, Frank Costigliola brings an important new and intriguing perspective to the origins of the Cold War."<b>--Ronald Steel, author of <i>Walter Lippmann and the American Century</i></b></p><p>"This is a terrific book. Fluidly written, cogently argued, and supported by superb research, it addresses a fundamental yet underexamined dimension of both the World War II Grand Alliance and the origins of the Cold War: the personalities as well as the personal relations of Churchill, Stalin, and Roosevelt."<b>--Richard H. Immerman, Temple University</b></p><p>"Costigliola has written an important and compelling book. His character portrayals of the three great wartime leaders are among the most incisive that have ever been written. He shows how critical Roosevelt was to the functioning of the alliance and how central his demise was to the origins of the Cold War. <i>Roosevelt's Lost Alliances</i> is a fantastically well researched, wonderfully evocative, stimulating, and significant book."<b>--Melvyn P.

Now all of Charlotte Mason&#x2019;s writings on Nature Study and the outdoors (from the original six-volume set) are located in this one, easy-to-use volume.<br> <br> The teachings and philosophies of Charlotte Mason, a British educator from the last century, are currently experiencing a revival, especially among American private and home schools. Mason&#x2019;s educational ideas were originally used by governesses in England to educate the children in their charge. Eventually, schools based on her philosophies sprung up throughout England, and her original training school became a college to supply teachers for the Parents&#x2019; Union Schools throughout the world.<br> <br> Mason developed a lifetime love of learning in her students by actively engaging children firsthand with nature, literature, science, history, art, music, and avoiding dumbed-down materials &#x2014; what she referred to as twaddle &#x2014; as much as possible.<br> <br> The content of <i>The Outdoor Life of Children</i> was compiled and adapted by Deborah Taylor-Hough, long time homeschooling mother of three, author of <i>A Twaddle-Free Education: An Introduction to Charlotte Mason&#x2019;s Timeless Educational Ideas</i>, and editor of the Charlotte Mason eMagazine.<br> <br> <b>CONTENTS INCLUDE:</b><br> <br> <ul><li>Knowledge Through Senses </li><li>Out-of-Door Geography </li><li>Flowers and Trees </li><li>&#x2018;Living Creatures&#x2019; </li><li>Field-Lore and Naturalists&#x2019; Books </li><li>Walks in Bad Weather </li><li>Teaching Natural Philosophy </li><li>... and more!<br> <br><b>From the Foreword:</b><br> <br> &#x201c;Nature Study is the backbone of introductory natural sciences in Charlotte Mason style homes and school, but Mason also felt it was beneficial for children to spend a great deal of time out-of-doors for their physical, emotional, and spiritual health. <br> <br> "In spite of often rainy, inclement weather, Charlotte Mason insisted on going out once-a-week for an official Nature Walk, allowing the children to experience and observe the natural environment firsthand. These excursions were nature walks, not nature talks.<br> <br> "In addition to the weekly Nature Walks, Mason also recommended children spend large quantities of time outside each day, no matter what the weather. Take a daily walk for fun and fresh air.<br> <br> &#x201c;I want to encourage those of you who don&#x2019;t have your own fields and forests, there are other readily available opportunities for outdoor play and learning activities. Basically, go outside with your kids as often as you can.

Detailed is an integrated, flexible psychotherapeutic approach that emphasizes building a strong therapeutic relationship, engaging clients "where they are," and addressing substance use within the larger context of their lives. The authors describe in very pragmatic terms how to use a combination of motivational, cognitive-behavioral, 12-step, and psychodynamic techniques with clients in different stages of change. Techniques are brought to life with numerous case vignettes, and appendices include reproducible client forms and handouts. </p></p><p><p><b>Arnold M.

Graduate students will find this book to be quite comprehensive and helpful in understanding how to create a therapeutic environment supportive of client change."--Dennis L. Thombs, PhD, Department of Health Education and Behavior, University of Florida&nbsp;"This is the kind of book psychotherapists need. Washton and Zweben provide the most important information available about alcohol and drug problems together with state-of-the-art intervention methods. Truly comprehensive, this volume contains detailed sections on a wide range of relevant topics, such as frequently abused drugs, typical comorbid disorders, the utilization of self-help groups, and relapse prevention. Anchored in the concept of adapting treatment to the client&#x2019;s stage of change, Washton and Zweben&#x2019;s approach to treatment is truly integrative and evidence based and incorporates the most effective strategies for intervention."--Jay L. Lebow, PhD, ABPP, LMFT, Senior Scholar and Clinical Professor, The Family Institute at Northwestern University<br><br> "This comprehensive and highly-readable book provides thoughtful and thorough guidance on all aspects of alcohol and drug abuse treatment in an office-based practice. The integrated, multifaceted approach described by these experienced and respected clinicians covers screening, assessment, treatment planning, engagement, treatment, and relapse prevention. Each aspect of treatment is superbly addressed in a pragmatic, accessible, and flexible manner. This book will serve as an invaluable resource for all office-based practitioners, regardless of disciplinary background."--Gerard J. Connors, PhD, Research Institute on Addictions, University at Buffalo, State University of New York<br><br> "Despite the prevalence of alcohol and other drug abuse, psychotherapists typically receive inadequate training in treating these problems and are reluctant to take on substance-abusing patients. This practical book promises to change all that. Washton and Zweben show clinicians how to assess the problem, engage the patient, develop a plan, carry out the treatment, deal with relapse, and more. This book will be enormously valuable for psychologists, social workers, counselors, and anyone else wishing to sharpen their skills in the treatment of the substance-abusing person, from graduate students to experienced clinicians."--Sigurd Ackerman, MD, President and Medical Director, Silver Hill Hospital<br><br> "I highly recommend this important resource. Of particular interest to psychotherapists in private practice, the book describes a variety of evidence-based approaches to working with clients who have addictive behavior problems, including those with concurrent disorders or dual diagnosis.

Alan Marlatt, PhD, Addictive Behaviors Research Center and Department of Psychology, University of Washington<br><br> "Finally, office-based therapists do not have to avoid or refer clients with substance use disorders and can get the detailed, practical, and science-based information they need to work with them. Washton and Zweben offer a patient-oriented, integrative, sophisticated, and practical approach that can increase the competence and confidence of all therapists, even the most knowledgeable, in managing alcohol and drug problems in their offices. They are first and foremost clinicians, with years of clinical experience with and knowledge of alcohol and drugs and the patients who abuse them. Their guide presents wise advice for managing everything from appointments and billing, to dependence and medications, to patients who relapse and how to incorporate referral to self-help groups. This guide empowers therapists with a wealth of information, advice, understanding, and strategies to help their patients move through the entire process of change to sustained recovery from alcohol and drug problems.

Lyly took up the story of two young women, Galatea (or Gallathea) and Phillida who are dressed up in male clothes by their fathers so that they can avoid the requirement of the god Neptune that every year &#39;the fairest and chastest virgin in all the country&#39; be sacrificed to a sea-monster. Hiding together in the forest, the two maidens fall in love, each supposing the other to be a young man. Galatea has become the subject of considerable feminist critical study in recent years. Midas (1590) uses mythology in quite a different way, dramatising two stories about King Midas in such a way as to fashion a satire of King Philip of Spain (and of any tyrant like him) for colossal greediness and folly. In the wake of the defeat of Philip&#39;s Armada fleet and its attempted invasion of England in 1588, this satire was calculated to win the approval of Queen Elizabeth and her court.</p><p>George K.

In a series of elegantly written essays, Michael Howard ponders the continuing significance of nationalism and its relationship to the growth of industrial societies, modernization, and war. He explores the conflicting ideologies that arose from industrialism, tracing the development of new political organisms and attitudes as mass communications and universal education raised and transformed the level of political consciousness throughout the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Howard argues that, although industrialization may tend to reduce belligerence by producing societies dedicated to material welfare rather than heroic achievement, organized violence remains a norm. In an introduction, he links these themes with the emergence of <i>perestroika</i> and <i>glasnost</i> in the Soviet sphere, with the difficulties experienced by Third World countries in creating viable political and economic communities, and with a Western bloc in which social tensions continue to increase.</p></p><p>In this highly readable new book, one of the most eminent military historians in the world discusses the processes of historical change that ignited European wars of the twentieth century. Michael Howard ponders the continuing significance of nationalism, explores the conflicting ideologies that arose from industrialism, and argues that, despite the tendency of modern societies to dedicate themselves to material welfare rather than to heroic achievement, organized violence remains a norm.This collection of essays and lectures, dating from Howard's tenure of the Regius Chair of Modern History at Oxford between 1980 and '89, reflects his interest in the connection between nationalism and war. In "War and Social Change" he argues that national self-consciousness was the driving force of international conflict in the 19th and first half of the present century. "The Edwardian Arms Race" examines the pre-WW I naval rivalry between Britain and Germany. "Prussia in European History" makes the point that the Nazi creed drew on many sources not specifically Prussian. Nationalism, in Howard's view, is "by far the most effective instrument of social mobilization . . . and so a most effective tool of war." This and similar observations are typical of the blandly general quality of the pieces. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Nelson&#39;s Student Bible New King James Version</h2><p><p>Nelson's Student Bible is built around the concerns of today's teens and young adults, with guidance for living in a pressure-cooker kind of world.

In order to earn his keep, Nicholas takes a teaching position at a deprived boarding school full of poor and hungry students, where under the rule of the cruel and corrupt one-eyed Wackford Squeers, his honourable nature chafes against the brutal regime. But in this depraved environment, sometimes even friendship and compassion can flourish...&#34;Nicholas Nickleby&#34; is the captivating story of one man&#39;s journey to fight a school&#39;s brutal and tyrannical rule, and a lesson in the consequences for those who conspire to bring about his downfall. This special edition features an exclusive introduction by the highly-acclaimed writer Peter Ackroyd, one of Britain&#39;s leading literary biographers.</p><p><i>Hodder Headline Audiobooks</i> presents abridged readings of some of the finest in drama, classic literature, popular fiction, poetry, children�s stories, and religious and inspirational works. Among Hodder Headline�s outstanding cast of readers and performers are Kenneth Branagh, Juliet Stevenson, Simon Callow, Stephen Fry, and Dame Judi Dench. Each set of cassettes is beautifully packaged and shrink-wrapped.Charles Dickens had an understanding of mid-Victorian society second to none, and genius and energy massive enough to make the absurdities and terrors of that society come alive on the page. Nicholas Nickleby, with its episodes of chicanery in finance and education, and the dramatic intensity with which it tells the story of its open-hearted protagonists - a young brother and sister at sea in a dangerous world - and its frightening villain, the magnificently rendered Ralph Nickleby, represents Dickens at his clear-eyed, indignant and mesmerizing best.</p><h2>The Expressiveness of the Body and the Divergence of Greek and Chinese Medicine</h2><p><p><b>A meditation on the human body as described by the classical Greeks and by the ancient Chinese.</b></p><p>At the heart of medical history is a deep enigma. The true structure and workings of the human body are, we casually assume, everywhere the same, a universal reality. But then we look into the past, and our sense of reality wavers: accounts of the body in diverse medical traditions often seem to describe mutually alien, almost unrelated worlds. The Expressiveness of the Body meditates on the contrasts between the human body described in classical Greek medicine and the body as envisaged by physicians in ancient China. It asks how this most basic of human realities came to be conceived by two sophisticated civilizations in radically diverging ways. And it seeks answers in fresh and unexpected topics, such as the history of tactile knowledge, the relationship between ways of seeing and ways of listening, and the evolution of bloodletting.</p></p><p>What are our bodies trying to tell us? In the scholarly yet delicately beautiful <i>The Expressiveness of the Body</i>, Japanese scholar Shigehisa Kuriyama examines two widely divergent traditions of diagnostic examination: Greek and Chinese. While at first glance it would seem that this would entail a straightforward familiar vs. exotic dichotomy for Western readers, only a short way into the book we realize that the ancient Greeks were just as foreign to us as the ancient Chinese. While there is some greater resemblance to modern medicine in the works of Galen and his contemporaries, Kuriyama shows us that their struggle to "decode" the body's signals was just as arbitrary--and just as accurate--as works like the <i>Huangdi Neijing</i>.<p> Showing that the often dramatic differences between their attitudes about signs such as pulse, breath, and blood both developed from and informed deeper beliefs about the nature of the body, Kuriyama exposes the highly subjective artistry of medicine. Like the proverbial blind men feeling the different parts of the elephant, the ancients focused exclusively on one set of traits and signs and developed a complex theoretical framework around it. Well documented and handsomely illustrated, <i>The Expressiveness of the Body</i> pokes and prods into the space between precise anatomical knowledge and the understanding of <i>qi</i> flow to find the rest of the elephant beyond the trunk, legs, and tail. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Shigehisa Kuriyama is Associate Professor and Staff Researcher at the International Research Center for Japanese Studies.</p><h2>Assessment Program United States: Making a New Nation Social Studies</h2><p>Book by HARCOURT SCHOOL PUBLISHERS</p><p></p><h2>Restoring the Lost Constitution: The Presumption of Liberty</h2><p><p>The U.S. Constitution found in school textbooks and under glass in Washington is not the one enforced today by the Supreme Court. In <i>Restoring the Lost Constitution</i>, Randy Barnett argues that since the nation's founding, but especially since the 1930s, the courts have been cutting holes in the original Constitution and its amendments to eliminate the parts that protect liberty from the power of government. From the Commerce Clause, to the Necessary and Proper Clause, to the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, to the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court has rendered each of these provisions toothless. In the process, the written Constitution has been lost.</p><p>Barnett establishes the original meaning of these lost clauses and offers a practical way to restore them to their central role in constraining government: adopting a "presumption of liberty" to give the benefit of the doubt to citizens when laws restrict their rightful exercises of liberty. He also provides a new, realistic and philosophically rigorous theory of constitutional legitimacy that justifies both interpreting the Constitution according to its original meaning and, where that meaning is vague or open-ended, construing it so as to better protect the rights retained by the people.</p><p>As clearly argued as it is insightful and provocative, <i>Restoring the Lost Constitution</i> forcefully disputes the conventional wisdom, posing a powerful challenge to which others must now respond.</p></p><p>2005 Lysander Spooner Award for Advancing the Literature of Liberty, Laissez Faire Books<p>"Step by step, Randy Barnett constructs an intriguing case for a moderately libertarian natural-rights Constitution that allows government action only when, and because, doing so protects the generously defined liberties of each person. Along the way he sheds new light on old controversies. This book should provoke the kind of controversy that advances our understanding of the Constitution."<b>--Mark Tushnet, Georgetown University Law Center, author of<i>The New Constitutional Order</i></b></p><p>"Randy Barnett makes two important arguments, one involving the interpretation of the Constitution by reference to original understandings, the other endorsing a libertarian tilt in resolving disputes about governmental powers. Constitutional scholars and students will find much to admire in Barnett's carefully nuanced arguments, whether or not they ultimately agree with his conclusions. But the book should attract general readers as well. It is remarkably well written, totally devoid of jargon, and presented in a conversational and courteous tone. A truly excellent book!"<b>--Sanford Levinson, University of Texas School of Law, author of<i>Constitutional Faith</i></b></p><p>"Randy Barnett's <i>Restoring the Lost Constitution</i> is a surprising book. It is surprising that a scholar as learned and competent as Barnett should undertake the defense of libertarianism--a perspective on the state and on law unfashionable among the intelligentsia for a century. It is surprising that he should defend it so well and reasonably. It is even more surprising that such a strong and comprehensive case can be made that this libertarian perspective not only was that of those who wrote and (more importantly) ratified the Constitution, but also that it is the lawful and proper way to interpret the Constitution today. This is an important and challenging book for anyone interested in American law and government."<b>--Charles Fried, Beneficial Professor of Law, Harvard Law School, author of <i>Saying What the Law Is: The Constitution in the Supreme Court</i></b></p><p>"Provocative in the best sense, this is a very readable book whose argument is clear and accessible even to those unversed in the details of constitutional law or theory. It is particularly suggestive and effective in connecting two disparate strands of conservative political and constitutional theory: traditional conservative respect for original constitutional meaning and libertarian commitment to individual rights."<b>--Keith Whittington, author of<i>Constitutional Interpretation: Textual Meaning, Original Intent, and Judicial Review</i></b></p><p>"This is an important book, one that everybody in the field will (or should) take account of. Randy Barnett puts forward a comprehensive, thoughtful, clear, concise, challenging, and historically plausible version of American Constitutionalism. He pulls together a tremendous amount of material, including some of the best recent revisionist scholarship on constitutional history, and sets this in a framework of great integrity and unity of vision."<b>--Michael Zuckert, University of Notre Dame, author of<i>Launching Liberalism: On Lockean Political Philosophy</i></b></p></p><h2>Standard Handbook for Civil Engineers (Handbook)</h2><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b><br>A revision of the classic reference covering all important principles and techniques needed by practicing civil engineers.

Authors who followed them, such as Patricia Wentworth, Dorothy Sayers, and, of course, Agatha Christie would not have thrived without the bold, fearless work of their predecessors&#x2015;and the genre would be much poorer for their absence. So while Agatha Christie may still reign supreme, it is important to remember that she did not ascend that throne except on the shoulders of the women who came before her&#x2015;and inspired her&#x2015;and who are now removed from her shadow once and for all by this superb new anthology by Leslie S.

Full of insights into the nature of love, attraction, faith, and loyalty, <em>Seraph on the Suwanee</em> is the compelling story of two people at once deeply in love and deeply at odds. The heroine, young Arvay Henson, is convinced she will never find true love and happiness, and defends herself from unwanted suitors by throwing hysterical fits and professing religious fervor. Arvay meets her match, however, in handsome Jim Meserve, a bright, enterprising young man who knows that Arvay is the woman for him, and refuses to allow her to convince him otherwise. With the same passion and understanding that have made <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em> a classic, Hurston explores the evolution of a marriage full of love but very little communication and the desires of a young woman In search of herself and her place in the world.</p></p><p>Seraph on the Suwanee is the compelling story of two people at once deeply in love and deeply at odds.

Barthes examines the parallel impulses of Loyola, the Jesuit saint, Sade, the renowned and sometimes pornographic libertine philosopher, and Fourier, the utopian theorist. All three, he makes clear, have been founders of languages--Loyola, the language of divine address; Sade, the language of erotic freedom; and Fourier, the language of social perfection and happiness. Each language is an all-enveloping system, a "secondary language" that isolates the adherent from the conventional world. The object of this book, Barthes makes clear, is not to decipher the content of these respective works, but to consider Sade, Fourier, and Loyola as creators of text. </p><p>"Here they are all three brought together, the evil writer, the great utopian, and the Jesuit saint. There is not intentional provocation in this assembling (were there provocation, it would rather consist in treating Sade, Fourier, and Loyola as though they had not had faith: in God, the Future, Nature), no transcendence (the sadist, the contestator, and the mystic are not redeemed by sadism, revolution, religion), and, I add of these studies, although first published (in part) seperately, was from the first conceived to join the others in one book: the book of Logothetes, founders of language."--from the Preface</p></p><p><p>Barthes examines the parallel impulses of Loyola, the Jesuit saint, Sade, the renowned and sometimes pornographic libertine philosopher, and Fourier, the utopian theorist.

G. Adler, a survivor of Theresienstadt and Auschwitz. Written in 1950, after Adler&#x2019;s emigration to England, The Journey was ignored by large publishing houses after the war and not released in Germany until 1962. Depicting the Holocaust in a unique and deeply moving way, and avoiding specific mention of country or camps&#x2013;even of Nazis and Jews&#x2013;The Journey is a poetic nightmare of a family&#x2019;s ordeal and one member&#x2019;s survival. Led by the doctor patriarch Leopold, the Lustig family finds itself &#x201c;forbidden&#x201d; to live, enduring in a world in which &#x201c;everyone was crazy, and once they finally recognized what was happening it was too late.&#x201d; Linked by its innovative style to the work of James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, The Journey portrays the unimaginable in a way that anyone interested in recent history and modern literature must read.</p><p>H. G. Adler was the author of twenty-six books of fiction, poetry, philosophy, and history. A survivor of the Holocaust, Adler later settled in England and began writing novels about his experience, <b>The Journey</b> being the first of six works of fiction. Working as a freelance writer and teacher throughout his life, Adler died in London in 1988.<br><br>Peter Filkins is an acclaimed translator and the recipient of a Berlin Prize fellowship in 2005 from the American Academy in Berlin, among other honors. He teaches writing and literature at Bard College at Simon&#x2019;s Rock in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.<i>Augury<br></i><br><br>Driven forth, certainly, yet without understanding, man is sub- jected to a fate that at one point appears to consist of misery, at another of happiness, then perhaps something else; but in the end everything is drowned in a boundlessness that tolerates no limit, against which, as many have said, any assertion is a rarity, an island in a measureless ocean. Therefore there is no cause for grief. Also, it&#x2019;s best not to seek out too many opinions, because, by linking delusions and fears to which we are addicted, strong views keep you constantly drawn to what does not exist, or even if it did, would seem prohibited. So you find yourself inclined to agree with this or that notion, the emptiness of a sensible or blindly followed bit of wisdom, until you finally become aware of how unfathomable any view is, and that one is wise to quietly refrain from getting too involved with the struggles to salvage anything from the rubbish heap, life&#x2019;s course demanding this of us already.<br><br>Thus some measure of peace is attained. It&#x2019;s a peace found in endless flight, but nonetheless genuine peace. It is to be sure not an escape from yourself, no matter how much it may seem so, but rather the flight that consists of a ceaseless progression along the winding paths of a solitary realm, and because you abide in this realm you can call it peace, for upon time&#x2019;s stage everything remains fixed in the present. You&#x2019;re still a part of this. You travel many roads, and in many towns you appear with your relatives and friends; you stand, you walk, you fall and die. You don&#x2019;t believe you&#x2019;re still on the stage, even when you acknowledge you were once on it. But you&#x2019;re wrong, for they took you away and set you back onstage amid the fleeting journey. You didn&#x2019;t escape, even when you seemed suddenly sunk, figuratively and literally.<br><br>Yet what happens onstage? Many analogies are sought that often capture something essential, but none serves us better than the metaphor of the journey, which we can think of as flight. But what entity is it amid all these travels that recalls its own essence? It&#x2019;s memory itself, which sets out on the journey and is also dragged along through constant wandering. This entity, however, cannot leave its present location; that&#x2019;s why it acts in the present and finds space enough to unfold upon a single stage, which allows nothing else to appear but this entity capable of remembering itself, and so the image of the journey as flight arrives at a sense of peace, the entity that experiences it having been born in memory itself.<br><br>We are often reproached for the passivity of our beginning, of how reluctant we were to bring matters out into the open. But we cannot blame ourselves for our own expulsion, for that would imply that we wanted to give up. Thus we begin our search for a resting place ever anew; driven perhaps by an insatiability that in the end defines us, we are the heralds of life. The previously drawn analogy between the journey and peace becomes nothing but an analogy unto itself the moment we apply it in practical terms, becoming invalid in the world at large, because now everything appears to be in motion and indeed transforms itself entirely through motion. With good reason, one could speak of a passion or obsession that would sweep others along with us insofar as we are able to capture the living breath of our experience in motion. For indeed, we are our own creation; whether we are denied or accepted at our final end, when one must answer for oneself, much more depends, namely the flourishing of a world that, out of its deepest despair and highest aspirations, is called upon to form its own, in a certain sense, eternal countenance amid the destruction of our only meaningful and yet impalpable achievement, one accomplished in and for itself without the participation and help of the world at large.<br><br>Thus peace is let go and is gone, though not entirely; its reflection is and remains discernible for anyone who remains aware, amid the fear and horror of each single moment, when all dignity and secrecy are threatened, that an indestructible kernel persists beneath all the terror of this theater of horrors, a core, one which should never be idealized, since its existence is known only to the searching heart. The unmistakable persistence of this core as the last stop on this journey is at the same time your first and deepest memory, yet that is exactly what we are compelled to remember, the core being so omnipresent that it can be described as neither far nor near. Indeed, that is why it becomes obvious that in the flux of our lives memory always remains, and that, much like a memory, we&#x2014;and thus an entire world&#x2014;lack a stable, unchanging place in which to live. Thus we remain in flight, there is no rest for us but the interior that we remember; we are travelers on a journey that not a single one of us chose or planned. This we cannot change, the journey has begun, and now it follows its own path; as it progresses, it does not ask for our approval, it does not care if we love it or hate it, yet it stands in our way as soon as we ourselves resist the way.<br><br>Perhaps some still expect to hear where we are headed, or that at least some sense of it will be given. Be patient!&#x2014;for the aim here to try to depict this rather than describe it is the best response. Those who have their doubts can be assured that the destination will not be forgotten, since worries about the prospect of our final destination drive us all; that&#x2019;s why we will always make sure to keep the destination in mind, even if reports from the rubbish heap often seem to believe us.<br><br>One thing must be made clear, if we assert that we have suffered, suffered a great deal; by that we cannot and do not wish to set ourselves off from the world, which in itself experiences nothing but suffering, yet in our indefatigable readiness to embrace this suffering, we do not allow ourselves to sink further into the horror through which we cannot help but walk. No, we are not lost, even when we assert our loss, in fact the many losses that we&#x2014;alone for the most part and with our humble powers&#x2014;cannot make up for. But we have set ourselves on the stage. There, as elsewhere, we wish to appear alone, although we are not forsaken. We are never forsaken.<br><br>And so we wish to walk on or not walk at all&#x2014;for whether or not we walk on or make any progress is certainly not up to us nor anyone else. And so allow us to exist; whether it be in the perpetual motion that brings peace, whether it be in memory that ventures toward peace, either ahead of it or behind, whether it be in flight, one speaks of the fleeting nature of appearances, so let us exist in appearances and remain constantly in motion. Indeed, since our eyes are open, and suffering is not all we experience, but also life, allow us to grant this ever-changing existence so full of memory its only proper name&#x2014;the journey.</p><h2>Comptia It Fundamentals Study Guide</h2><p><p><b><i>NOTE:</i> The exam this book covered, CompTIA IT Fundamentals (Exam FCO-U51), was retired by CompTIA in 2019 and is no longer offered.</b> For coverage of the current exam CompTIA IT Fundamentals+: Exam FCO-U61, please look for the latest edition of this guide: <i>CompTIA IT Fundamentals+ Study Guide: Exam FCO-U61 </i>(9781119513124).</p> <p><br>Information Technology is not just about what applications you can use; it is about the systems you can support.

In this colorful and informative book, authors Hooper and Bennett debunk many of the myths surrounding medieval warfare to present a picture of a military culture as sophisticated as our modern one, with well organized armies and a high degree of tactical intelligence. The authors make their case by masterful use of high-quality maps, battle plans, and pictorial essays that explore such topics as siege warfare, the use of cavalry, the development of naval warfare, medieval science and warfare, and the legacy of the Middle Ages in modern military warfare. The Atlas spans the period from the coronation of Charlemagne to the last of the English Wars of the Roses and covers campaigns in and around Europe and the Mediterranean. The illustrations depict all levels of warfare from the strategic campaigns down to individual battles, fortifications, and weaponry. The lucid narrative that accompanies the pictures explains the course of campaigns and lessons to be learned from them. This book is written for the general reader with an interest in the history of warfare.</p><p>This is a highly readable account of European warfare from the Battle of Poitiers to the Wars of the Roses. With full-colour maps and illustration, the authors focus on military and naval culture, tactics, logistics, and science of warfare, revealing an unexpectedly sophisticated and varied military era.The ingredients of medieval warfare--armor, warhorses, small arms, the siege, archers, knights--are discussed and pictured in this highly illustrated popular history. A companion atlas, <i>Renaissance to Revolution, 1492^-1792</i>, is to be published this month.<p>The main purpose of the atlas is to trace the development of warfare from Charlemagne through the War of the Roses. Discussion is divided into four major sections: "The Crucible of Europe," (742^-1016), "Western Europe in the Eleventh to the Thirteenth Centuries," "Expanding Europe: The Crusades," and "Europe Divided: The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries." A brief section is devoted to the theory and practice of medieval warfare, offering brief information on fortresses, gunpowder, laws of war, chivalry, mercenaries, etc. There is a glossary, a bibliography of recommended secondary sources, a chronology (limited to events covered in the atlas), and an index.</p><p>The strength of the work is its illustrations. Maps are used to good effect to show political boundaries, cities, placement of armies, invasion routes, and marches. Three-and four-color drawings are used to show battle positions and troop movement during battle. These are quite helpful and relate to the text. Every map has a key explaining colors and symbols. Some of the many attractive photographs of paintings, engravings, and tapestries are too pale.</p><p>This historical atlas will appeal to young adults and lay adults and should be placed in the general circulating collection of high-school and public libraries. Not an essential purchase for larger academic and public libraries. <i></i></p></p><h2>Houghton Mifflin English: Workbook Plus Teacher&#39;s Annotated Edition Grade 3</h2><p>Houghton Mifflin English: Workbook Plus Teacher&#39;s Annotated Edition Grade 3</p><p></p><h2>HERmione</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;H.

It is the story of a second chance.<br><br>Anne Elliot, daughter of the snobbish, spendthrift Sir Walter Elliot, is a woman of quiet charm and deep feelings. When she was nineteen, she fell in love with&#x2013;and was engaged to&#x2013;a naval officer, the fearless and headstrong Captain Wentworth. But the young man had no fortune, and Anne allowed herself to be persuaded, against her profoundest instinct, to give him up.Now, at twenty-seven, and believing that she has lost her bloom, Anne is startled to learn that Captain Wentworth has returned to the neighborhood, a rich man and still unwed. Her never-diminished love is muffled by her pride. He seems cold and unforgiving. Even worse, he appears to be infatuated by the flighty and pretty Louisa Musgrove.<br><br>What happens as Anne and Wentworth are thrown together in the social world of Bath&#x2013;and as an eager new suitor appears for Anne&#x2013;is touchingly and wittily told in a masterpiece that is also one of the most entrancing novels in the English language.</p><p>Anne Elliot, heroine of Austen&#39;s last novel, did something we can all relate to: Long ago, she let the love of her life get away. In this case, she had allowed herself to be persuaded by a trusted family friend that the young man she loved wasn&#39;t an adequate match, social stationwise, and that Anne could do better. The novel opens some seven years after Anne sent her beau packing, and she&#39;s still alone. But then the guy she never stopped loving comes back from the sea. As always, Austen&#39;s storytelling is so confident, you can&#39;t help but allow yourself to be taken on the enjoyable journey.This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

Mead ( Baseball Goes to War ) compares the major league seasons of 1930, the year of the hitter, and 1968, the year of the pitcher. In the former, the batting average for the entire National League was .303, with New York Giant Bill Terry hitting .401 and Chicago Cubs Hack Wilson batting in 190 runs. In 1968 Detroit Tigers pitcher Denny McLaine won 31 games and St. Louis Cardinals hurler Bob Gibson had the lowest earned run average of the century, 1.12. But the book is not a dry compilation of statistics: Mead analyzes trends in the game between the '20s and '60s and changes in the ball and the height of the pitcher's mound, and presents the personalities who added drama to the sport, from the feisty, acerbic John McGraw, manager of the New York Giants in the early '20s, to the flamboyant McLaine. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Flamingo&#39;s Smile: Reflections in Natural History</h2><p><p><strong>"Gould himself is a rare and wonderful animal&#x2015;a member of the endangered species known as the ruby-throated polymath. . . . [He] is a leading theorist on large-scale patterns in evolution . . . [and] one of the sharpest and most humane thinkers in the sciences." --David Quammen, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong></p></p><p>Stephen Jay Gould (1941-2002) was the Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology and Professor of Geology at Harvard University. He published over twenty books, received the National Book and National Book Critics Circle Awards, and a MacArthur Fellowship.This is Gould's fourth volume of essays reprinted, with postscripts, from Natural History. Gould's monthly columns seem to take on new meaning in these collectionseach becomes a piece in a mosaic pattern of thought. Thus, The Flamingo's Smile gives a glimpse at the big picture. The essay on the extinction of dinosaurs is placed effectively next to a consideration of humanity's possible extinction through nuclear war. The discussions of evolutionary biology include new pieces from recent research and revisions in previously held beliefs, as well as a surprisingly relevant essay on the decline in batting averages in major league baseball. And, for the first time, Gould writes for the general reader on his own research on Bahamian land snails. This book requires undivided attention, but the reward is special insight into the complexities of evolutionary biology. Susan Klimley, Columbia Univ.

Plus, updates throughout the book keep you on top of new MI resources, tools, and materials.</p><p>&#x201c;To respect the many differences between people&#x201d;&#x2014;this is what Howard Gardner says is the purpose of learning about multiple intelligences (MI) theory, which holds that the human mind is composed of eight intelligences&#x2014;linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic&#x2014;plus a possible ninth (existential). This updated 3rd edition of Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom, Thomas Armstrong&#x2019;s bestselling practical guide for educators, includes two new chapters that address the worldwide reach of MI and rebut some common criticisms of the theory. This new edition includes updated information and resources throughout the text to help educators at all levels apply MI theory to curriculum development, lesson planning, assessment, special education, cognitive skills, educational technology, career development, educational policy, and more. The book includes dozens of practical tips, strategies, and examples from real schools and districts. Armstrong provides tools, resources, and ideas that educators can immediately use to help students of all ages achieve their fullest potential in life.Thomas M. Armstrong is a veteran of the early 1960s civil rights movement in his native Mississippi. He was at the forefront of early protests led by black Southerners for voting rights and equal public accommodations from 1958-1961, resulting in threats that had him running for his life. Mr. Armstrong moved to Chicago where he has resided since 1964. He remains closely allied with other former Freedom Riders and civil rights workers around the country and often speaks at schools and civic organizations such as the African American Leadership Roundtable in Chicago. He has been the subject of scholarly research by respected academics, sought after for major media interviews, and featured in print from critically acclaimed books to a Forbes magazine publication.

Gustav Niebuhr travels back to this defining period, to explore Abraham Lincoln's decision to spare the lives of 265 Sioux men sentenced to die by a military tribunal in Minnesota for warfare against white settlers&#x2014;while allowing the hanging of 38 others, the largest single execution on American soil. Popular opinion favored death or expulsion. Only one state leader championed the cause of the Native Americans, Episcopal bishop, Henry Benjamin Whipple.</p><p>Though he'd never met an Indian until he was 37 years old, Whipple befriended them before the massacre and understood their plight at the hands of corrupt government officials and businessmen. After their trial, he pleaded with Lincoln to extend mercy and implement true justice. Bringing to life this little known event and this extraordinary man, Niebuhr pays tribute to the once amazing moral force of mainline Protestant churches and the practitioners who guarded America's conscience.</p><p><em>Lincoln's Bishop</em> is illustrated with 16 pages of black-and-white photos.</p></p><p><p>It is hard to recall what powerful moral voices Protestant church leaders had in the formative years of the nation. Gustav Niebuhr travels back to the Minnesota frontier of 1862 when Dakota Sioux rose up against pioneering families and slaughtered hundreds. Citizens demanded mass executions and deportations. Into this turmoil stepped Henry Benjamin Whipple, the state's first Episcopal bishop.</p><p>Whipple had already loudly decried the crimes and corruption of those managing Indian affairs and warned of calamity. Now he made the case of mercy and a deeper justice, which eventually led to meeting with President Lincoln. Despite being preoccupied with the Civil War, Lincoln was moved to intervene, surprisingly taking the time to review all 303 cases and overturning the death sentence for most of the Indians. Nevertheless, the result was still the largest single execution on American soil.</p><p>If not for Whipple's vigorous campaigning, both in state and in Washington, DC, a greater tragedy might well have occurred. His success should haunt us: Where today do we hear these trumpet calls for justice like those given by figures such as Bishop Henry Benjamin Whipple?</p><p>Gustav Niebuhr is associate professor of newspaper and online journalism at Syracuse University and founding director of the Carnegie Religion and Media Program.

Ever since Copernicus, scientists have been moving man further and further from his lofty position at the center of Creation. But in recent years a startling new concept has evolved that puts humans more firmly than ever in a special position. Known as the Anthropic Cosmological Principle, it holds that the fundamental structure of the Universe is determined by the existence of intelligent observers: the universe is as it is because if it were otherwise, observers could not exist. In its most radical version, the Anthropic Principle asserts: "Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the Universe, and once it comes into existence, it will never die out."<br> More than a revolutionary theoretical concept, the anthropic principle can be used as a powerful predictive tool leading to a fundamental change in the way we understand physical phenomena. This groundbreaking work explores the many ramifications of the principle and covers the whole spectrum of human inquiry from Aristotle to Z bosons. Chapters cover the definition and nature of life, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and the interpretation of the quantum theory in relation to the existence of observers. The book will be of vital interest to philosophers, theologians, mathematicians, scientists, and historians--and to anyone who ever wondered if there was any connection between the vastness of the universe of stars and galaxies and the existence of life within it on a small planet out in the suburbs of the Milky Way.<br> <br> About the Authors:<br> <br> John D.

With deep pockets, teams of attorneys, and influential lobbyists in the state legislature, the second-largest oil company in the world could demand--and get--essentially anything it wanted. Until it met Michael Veron and his family.<br><br><b>Shell Game</b> is the dramatic, fast-paced true account of a nine-year battle pitting a Louisiana family of modest means against Shell in an effort to clean up decades of pollution on the family&#x2019;s property. Bullied, intimidated, and dubbed &#x201c;the Beverly Hillbillies&#x201d; by Shell&#x2019;s highly paid attorneys, author Michael Veron&#x2019;s relatives refused to buckle&#x2014;and continued their fight against tremendous odds.<br><br>A small-town lawyer, Veron led the fight against Shell. His first-person account of the struggle is gripping, tense, and ultimately uplifting. It is a story of greed and great passion and of one family&#x2019;s refusal to back down in the face of unrelenting pressure. <b>Shell Game</b> is the story of how one family not only righted a wrong, but also changed the way oil companies operate.<br><br></p><p><b>J. Michael Veron</b> is a trial attorney, author, and law professor at Louisiana State University. Veron&#x2019;s earlier works of fiction earned him the title of "master of fiction" from <i>USA Today</i>, and <i>Travel and Leisure Golf</i> magazine called him "The John Grisham of Golf." <b>Shell Game</b> is his first work of nonfiction.<br>.Legal narratives pitting the hero against a malicious corporation are not in short supply, but trial lawyer Veron adds an environmental twist as he describes nine years fighting Shell Oil over decades of pollution on his family's Louisiana farm. By 1991, after his family had made a comfortable income for 62 years off the royalties from the discovery of oil on his great-grandfather's property, the land was covered with discarded equipment and poisoned with chemicals and buried toxic waste. Spurred by a cousin who wondered why the company wasn't vacating the property and cleaning it up as required by the lease, Veron spent more than a year trying to persuade Shell to fulfill its contract and pay damages, before he filed suit. Veron delivers a blow-by-blow account of the trial, quoting testimony liberally, often stepping back to discuss his and his opponent's tactics and to explain the law. An accomplished novelist (<i>The Caddie</i>), Veron uses his considerable skill to portray Shell's lawyers (incompetent), the judge (inexperienced and hostile) and witnesses (his are devastating). Readers won't be surprised that he wins a huge settlement. Less biased accounts such as <i>A Civil Action</i> tell a more realistic and equally fascinating story, but this simpler good-versus-evil tale is a cracking good read. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Why do we think that noises have colors and that colors can be loud? How loud is too loud, and says who? Attending, as ears do, to a surround of sounds at once physical and political, Hillel Schwartz listens across millennia for changes in the Western experience and understanding of noise. From the uproarious junior gods of Babylonian epics to crying infants heard over baby monitors, from doubly mythic Echo to amplifier feedback, from shouts frozen in Rabelaisian air to the squawk of loudspeakers and the static of shortwave radio, <i>Making Noise</i> follows &#x201c;unwanted sound&#x201d; on its surprisingly revealing path through terrains domestic and industrial, urban and rural, legal and religious, musical and medical, poetic and scientific. At every stage, readers can hear the cultural reverberations of the historical soundwork of actresses, admen, anthropologists, astronomers, builders, composers, dentists, economists, engineers, filmmakers, firemen, grammar school teachers, jailers, nurses, oceanographers, pastors, philosophers, poets, psychologists, and the writers of children's books.<br><br>Drawing upon such diverse sources as the archives of antinoise activists and radio advertisers, catalogs of fireworks and dental drills, letters and daybooks of physicists and physicians, military manuals and training films, travel diaries and civil defense pamphlets, as well as museum collections of bells, ear trumpets, megaphones, sirens, stethoscopes, and street organs, Schwartz traces the process by which noise today has become as powerfully metaphorical as the original Babel.</p><p>Endnotes and bibliography are not included in the physical book but are available online at the MIT Press Web site.</p></p><p>Hillel Schwartz is the author of <i>Making Noise: From Babel to the Big Bang and Beyond.</i><p>Schwartz is a writer's writer, meaning that he is a sublime stylist, can turn a phrase you'll never forget</p>&#x2015;<b>Darren Tofts</b>, <i>RealTime</i><br><br><p>For me, this book is a starting point for a hundred dissertations.

These striking images, which transformed prosaic objects into modernist masterpieces&#x2013;were the foundation for work she later did for Fortune, Life, and other important national magazines. Organized by the Phillips Collection, an exhibition and this accompanying catalogue feature many photographs which have never before been published, and presents new research on the images.

By first muscling in as a master of the masculine art of corporate photography. For the first time, that early work has gotten its due in Stephen Bennett Phillips&#x2019; <i>Margaret Bourke-White: The Photography of Design 1927-36</i>. In insightful prose and glossily reproduced black-and-white photos, he opens our eyes to her fast-developing genius. Her 1927 photos of Cleveland&#x2019;s Terminal Tower expertly aped the fuzzy, romantic pictorialism of early Edward Steichen, but her 1928 shot of the same building through the spiral grillwork shows her rigorous sense of composition. After she discovered magnesium lighting, her pictures of what could&#x2019;ve been ordinary industrial scenes acquired stunning star power. Rows of tin soup cans, aluminum rods, hogs hanging in a stockyard, Moscow ballet dancers, Wurlitzer organ pipes: she transformed them all into patterns bespeaking brute power. Her camera was a magic device that transformed everything she saw into a shiny Deco masterpiece. This book is as smart and beautiful as its stellar subject. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>Stephen Bennet Phillips is Associate Curator at the Phillips Collection in Washington, <br>D.

Ravitch and Nicole Mittenfelner Carl call "criticality" in qualitative research by communicating its foundations and processes with clarity and simplicity while still capturing complexity. Packed with real-life examples of questions, issues, and situations that stem from the authors&#x2019; and their students&#x2019; research, the book humanizes the qualitative research endeavor, illustrates the types of scenarios that arise, and emphasizes the importance of actively considering paradigmatic values throughout every stage of the research process.

Hawley Prize.</i> <br><strong></strong></b><strong><br><strong>A prize-winning, five-decade history of the evangelical movement in Southern California that explains a sweeping realignment of American politics.</strong><br><b></b><br><i>From Bible Belt to Sun Belt</i> tells the dramatic and largely unknown story of "plain-folk" religious migrants: hardworking men and women from Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas who fled the Depression and came to California for military jobs during World War II. Investigating this fiercely pious community at a grassroots level, Darren Dochuk uses the stories of religious leaders, including Billy Graham, as well as many colorful, lesser-known figures to explain how evangelicals organized a powerful political machine. This machine made its mark with Barry Goldwater, inspired Richard Nixon's "Southern Solution," and achieved its greatest triumph with the victories of Ronald Reagan. Based on entirely new research, the manuscript has already won the prestigious Allan Nevins Prize from the Society of American Historians. The judges wrote, "Dochuk offers a rich and multidimensional perspective on the origins of one of the most far-ranging developments of the second half of the twentieth century: the rise of the New Right and modern conservatism." 8 pages of photographs</strong></p><p><b>Darren Dochuk</b> is Associate Professor in the Humanities at the John C.

But the explosion of serious historical research in the last half-century has fueled a keen desire for a better-informed and more satisfying understanding of the Scottish past. <br> This attractively designed book--boasting scores of illustrations, include eight color plates--brings together the leading authorities on Scottish history, who range from Roman times until the present day, offering a more accurate and sophisticated portrait of Scotland through the ages. The contributors take us from medieval Scotland, to the crisis created by Mary Queen of Scots and the trauma of Reformation, to the reign of James VI and the Union of the Crowns (1603). They discuss the seventeenth century, when a stern Calvinist Kirk launched an unprecedented attack on music, dancing, drama, and drinking, and the remarkable transformation of enlightenment Scotland, when the small nation became a great force in European literature, with such eminent figures as David Hume, Adam Smith, Robert Burns, and James Boswell. We discover that in the nineteenth century the Scottish economy, by some criteria, outpaced the rest of Britain, and its preeminence in heavy engineering was unquestioned. And we follow Scotland through the turbulent twentieth century, enduring two world wars and a depression, before ending on a high note, with Scotland enjoying its first parliament in three hundred years. <br> What emerges here is a portrait of a confident people who slowly built an important place for themselves in the wider world--the story of a remarkably positive, assured, and successful kingdom.</p><p><br><strong>Jenny Wormald</strong> is currently Fellow and Tutor in Modern History at St Hilda's College, Oxford.

Barash, there are even more things that we don't know, genuine evolutionary mysteries that perplex the best minds in biology. Paradoxically, many of these mysteries are very close to home, involving some of the most personal aspects of being human.<br><br><em>Homo Mysterious </em>examines a number of these evolutionary mysteries, exploring things that we don't yet know about ourselves, laying out the best current hypotheses, and pointing toward insights that scientists are just beginning to glimpse. Why do women experience orgasm? Why do men have a shorter lifespan than women? Why does homosexuality exist? Why does religion exist in virtually every culture? Why do we have a fondness for the arts? Why do we have such large brains? And why does consciousness exist? Readers are plunged into an ocean of unknowns--the blank spots on the human evolutionary map, the terra incognita of our own species--and are introduced to the major hypotheses that currently occupy scientists who are attempting to unravel each puzzle (including some solutions proposed here for the first time). Throughout the book, readers are invited to share the thrill of science at its cutting edge, a place where we know what we don't know, and, moreover, where we know enough to come up with some compelling and seductive explanations.<br><br><em>Homo Mysterious</em> is a guide to creative thought and future explorations, based on the best, most current thinking by evolutionary scientists. It captures the allure of the "not-yet-known" for those interested in stretching their scientific imaginations.<br></p><p><br>David P. Barash is Professor of Psychology and Biology at the University of Washington, Seattle, and author or coauthor of dozens of books, including <em>The Hare and the Tortoise: The Conflict between Culture and Biology in Human Affairs</em>; <em>Madame Bovary's Ovaries: A Darwinian Look at Literature</em>; and <em>Payback: Why We Retaliate, Redirect Aggression, and Take Revenge</em>. He is also a regular contributor to the <em>Chronicle of Higher Education </em>and to the op-ed page of the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, one of the founders of sociobiology, a Fellow of the AAAS, and the recipient of numerous awards.<br><br>"A beautifully written book. It has the wisdom of maturity but with none of its ponderousness, the enthusiasm of youth with none of its brashness." -- Richard Dawkins, author of <em>The God Delusion</em> <br><p></p><br>"David Barash has long been one of our wittiest, warmest, and most insightful writers on the implications of evolution for human nature." -- Steven Pinker, Harvard College Professor of Psychology, Harvard University, and author of <em>How the Mind Works</em> and <em>The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence</em> <em>Has Declined</em> <br><p></p><br>"David Barash is a thinker who combines deep understanding of evolutionary science with a deft pen, an unpretentious erudition, and a mischievous sense of humor. If you've ever been puzzled by, longed for, or found comfort in female orgasms, literary art, or the idea of an afterlife, this is your chance to see how a wise scientist uses Darwinian theory to try to unravel those riddles, and many more besides." -- Melvin Konner, author of <em>The Evolution of Childhood: Relationships, Emotion, Mind</em> and <em>The Tangled Wing: Biological Constraints on the Human Spirit</em> <br><p></p><br>"David Barash is incapable of writing a dull word. Any discussion of human nature is bound to be controversial, and Barash is fearless in plunging in and assessing ideas and making suggestions. You will surely not agree with everything he says, but equally surely, you will come away better informed and wiser in your future judgments about our ever-fascinating species." -- Michael Ruse, editor of <em>The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Darwin and Evolution</em> <br><p></p><br>"A thoughtful, witty book." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Evolutionary psychologist David Barash takes a crack at the enduring enigmas of human evolution. Starting with what we don't know, he strides boldly into a jungle of hypotheses. It is an entertaining exploration through sexual phenomena such as concealed ovulation, breasts and the menopause; art, where explanations such as Steven Pinker's "cheesecake for the mind" feature; the roots of religion, from the "God gene" to feel-good neurochemicals; and, finally, our big brains and the vast reach of human intelligence." -- <em>Nature</em><p></p><br>"After summarizing current scientific research on these topics, Barash discusses supporting or contradictory theories, acknowledging that, while much is speculation, it is only through discussion and examination that explanations may eventually be found. A prolific writer, Barash has discussed issues of sexuality and sociobiology in previous books, e.g., How Women Got Their Curves and Other Just-So Stories and The Gender Gap: The Biology of Male-Female Differences. VERDICT A fascinating, well-researched introduction to the conundrums of evolutionary psychology and sociobiology written for the general reader." -- Lucille M. Boone, San Jos� P.L., CA, <em>Library Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Homo Mysterious: Evolutionary Puzzles of Human Nature</em> (Oxford), a new book by David Barash, a professor of psychology and biology at the University of Washington, Seattle, inadvertently illustrates how just-so stories about humanity remain strikingly oversold. As Barash works through the common evolutionary speculations about our sexual behavior, mental abilities, religion, and art, he shows how far we still are from knowing how to talk about the evolution of the mind." -- Anthony Gottlieb, <em>The New Yorker</em> <br><p></p><br>"...<em>Homo Mysterious</em> poses fascinating questions, and the potential answers are often informative." -- <em>Science News </em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Homo Mysterious</em> is a well-researched, well-articulated, and unpretentious attempt to resolve a number of unanswered human evolutionary questions." --<em>The Quarterly Review of Biology</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Bible Knowledge Commentary Major Prophets (BK Commentary)</h2><p><b>Hard Truths and Amazing Grace</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel spoke words of warning, comfort, and punishment to the people of Israel in Judah and during the Babylonian Captivity.

Since the early 1960s, artists have employed destruction to creative ends. Here destruction changes from a negative state or passive condition to a highly productive category.

The self-destructing artwork extinguishes art's fixity as arrested form and ushers in the ephemeral and contingent "open work."</p><p>This anthology explores artworks that convey the threat of destruction an how they have disrupted the perceived integrity of built structures and institutions. Artistic acts of iconoclasm or risk to the self have raised consciousness of authoritarian oppression.

Now the Bibliotheque Nationale de France and The New York Public Library are jointly sponsoring a major exhibition that explores the utopian imagination and the myriad attempts to achieve utopia, showcasing a spectacular collection of art and literature.<br> <em>Utopia: The Search for the Ideal Society in the Western World</em> is the catalog for the American exhibition, which will be on view in New York from October 14, 2000 through January 2001. Featuring essays by curator Roland Schaer and by Alain Touraine, Lyman Tower Sargent, and other leading European and American scholars of utopia, this elegantly designed volume will explore the long tradition of thought and art envisioning the "perfect place," extending from classical antiquity to the present. Lavishly illustrated with more than 200 pictures, most of them in color, <em>Utopia</em> presents such fascinating images as Theodore de Bry's 16th-century idealized drawings of the native inhabitants of the New World, Renaissance renderings of ideal architecture, posters from the Soviet Union and the 1939 World's Fair in New York, and photographs of experimental communities. Included as well are such resonant documents as a copy of the Declaration of Independence in Thomas Jefferson's hand, stunning illuminated manuscripts, and rare items relating to the French Revolution and to the social utopias of the Romantic Age from the collections of the Biblioth�que Nationale.<br> Both beautiful and intellectually provocative, <em>Utopia</em> is the perfect vehicle to explore an idea that has arisen, in many forms and many places, throughout human history.</p><p>Roland Schaer was Director of Cultural Development at the Bibliotheque nationale de France from 1994 to 2000.

He performs thoroughly and brilliantly the examination that Kenneth Burke saw as a crying need on the brink of World War II. The questions Professor Stern asks are fundamental and still of the first importance in our own society. How could a predominantly sober, hardworking, and well-educated nation be persuaded to follow Hitler and his inhuman and destructuve program? What was the source of his immense popularity? Why were his public utterances so powerfully persuasive? What were the shared assumptions behind "The Final Solution," Operation Barbarossa, "The Night of the Long Knives"?<br><br>Professor Stern has done a pioneering study of the rhetoric of Nazism, a rhetoric that coupled words and action. He examines the speeches, writings, and conversations of Hitler and places them in the context of traditional beliefs of the society into which Hitler, the "ideal outsider," made his way. With terrifying logic his career emerges as the creation of a man who translated the private sphere of sentiment into the public sphere of political action, the will to power into a weapon of mass hypnosis.</p><p></p><h2>Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions</h2><p>Anyone who watches the television news has seen images of firefighters rescuing people from burning buildings and paramedics treating bombing victims. How do these individuals make the split-second decisions that save lives? Most studies of decision making, based on artificial tasks assigned in laboratory settings, view people as biased and unskilled. Gary Klein is one of the developers of the naturalistic decision making approach, which views people as inherently skilled and experienced. It documents human strengths and capabilities that so far have been downplayed or ignored.<br> <br> Since 1985, Klein has conducted fieldwork to find out how people tackle challenges in difficult, nonroutine situations. <i>Sources of Power</i> is based on observations of humans acting under such real-life constraints as time pressure, high stakes, personal responsibility, and shifting conditions. The professionals studied include firefighters, critical care nurses, pilots, nuclear power plant operators, battle planners, and chess masters. Each chapter builds on key incidents and examples to make the description of the methodology and phenomena more vivid. In addition to providing information that can be used by professionals in management, psychology, engineering, and other fields, the book presents an overview of the research approach of naturalistic decision making and expands our knowledge of the strengths people bring to difficult tasks.</p><p>Gary Klein studies decision-making in the field, tagging along with firefighters, standing by in intensive-care units, and watching chess masters play lightning-fast "blitz" games to learn how people make choices with time constraints, limited information, and changing goals. From this research, he and his associates have developed a theory of "naturalistic decision-making."<p> <i>Sources of Power</i> essentially lends the validity of scientific research to techniques that many of us use every day. There's intuition, which is based not on instantaneous insight but on the rapid (perhaps even subconscious) interpretation of perceptual cues. There's mental simulation, a finely honed method of visualization. There's storytelling and metaphor, which enable decision-makers to devise meaningful frameworks and compare their present situations to previous events. Nobody is born with an inherent <i>mastery</i> of these and other techniques, Klein tells us, but we are all born with the <i>capability</i> to develop, through experience, the skill sets experts call upon to make good decisions.</p>Gary Klein is a Senior Scientist at Applied Research Associates. He is the author of <i>Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions</i> (1999) and the coauthor of <i>Working Minds: A Practitioner's Guide to Cognitive Task Analysis</i> (2006), both published by the MIT Press.</p><h2>Manual Of Aphasia Therapy</h2><p>...a comprehensive guide to the rehabilitation of adults with acquired aphasia</p><p></p><h2>Meanings of Life</h2><p>Who among us has not at some point asked, ``what is the meaning of life?'' In this extraordinary book, an eminent social scientist looks at the big picture and explores what empirical studies from diverse fields tell us about the human condition. MEANINGS OF LIFE draws together evidence from psychology, history, anthropology, and sociology, integrating copious research findings into a clear and conclusive discussion of how people attempt to make sense of their lives. In a lively and accessible style, emphasizing facts over theories, Baumeister explores why people desire meaning in their lives, how these meanings function, what forms they take, and what happens when life loses meaning. It is the most comprehensive examination of the topic to date.<br></p><p>Roy F. Baumeister, PhD, is Professor of Psychology at Florida State University and at the University of Queensland in Australia. Dr. Baumeister has written more than 600 professional publications and numerous books for professionals and the general public. His research on self-regulation addresses such topics as aggression, eating, sexuality, emotion, limited resources, addiction, free will, physiology, and task performance."Roy Baumeister writes conceptually exact, richly factual, and continuously delightful books on deep subjects, and this is his best." --Roger Brown, Ph.D.<br><br>"The topic is, of course, tremendous. We feel giddily nervous on even entertaining it, and so usually take it for granted or leave it to Monty Python. Fortunately, this volume has now arrived, bringing with it a far-reaching analysis of how life's meaning impinges on social life. It is rare to find such a broad array of intriguing and subtle hypotheses derived from a single theme, and even more rare to find such wide-ranging awareness of history and culture in contemporary social psychology." --Daniel M. Wegner, Ph.D.<br><br>"The book encourages the reader to struggle with hard questions that have no objective answers." --Jerry Bruce, Sam Houston State, Huntsville, Texas <br><br><br>"A scholarly and intriguing review of research and thought on finding meaningfulness in life.

In the conventional view, the impetus for such a dramatic reversal was provided by external political pressures manifested in FDR's landslide victory in the 1936 election, and by the subsequent Court-packing crisis. Author Barry Cushman, by contrast, discounts the role that political pressure played in securing this "constitutional revolution." Instead, he reorients study of the New Deal Court by focusing attention on the internal dynamics of doctrinal development and the role of New Dealers in seizing opportunities presented by doctrinal change.<br><br>Recasting this central story in American constitutional development as a chapter in the history of ideas rather than simply an episode in the history of politics, Cushman offers a thoroughly researched and carefully argued study that recharacterizes the mechanics by which laissez-faire constitutionalism unraveled and finally collapsed during FDR's reign. Identifying previously unseen connections between several different lines of doctrine, <em>Rethinking the New Deal Court</em> charts the manner in which <em>Nebbia v. New York</em>'s abandonment of the distinction between public and private enterprise hastened the demise of the doctrinal structure in which that distinction had played a central role. As intelligent as it is revisionist, this volume will greatly interest students of legal history, constitutional law, and political science.<br></p><p>Barry Cushman is Associate Professor of Law at Saint Louis University.<br>"A meticulous craftsman, Cushman builds a convincing case for his revisionist thesis. His book is a smooth blend of intellectual and political history; he is equally at home with the nuances of legal doctrine on the Court and the political battles going on outside it. He brings out of the large unruly mass of constitutional cases decided between 1870 and 1937 a strong, clear story, powerful in its simplicity and very persuasive. After this book no one will be able to talk about the 'Constitutional Revolution of the New Deal' in quite the same way again."--Robert W. Gordon, Yale Law School<p></p><br>"It is not often that a book comes along that provides a whole new way of thinking about a familiar subject. But Barry Cushman has written a convincing, revolutionary reinterpretation of the conventional wisdom about the so-called 'Constitutional Revolution of 1937' and its notorious 'switch in time'. In the process, Cushman provides us with a compelling and powerful counter-argument about the true origins and dimensions of constitutional and historical change in the New Deal period."--Alfred S. Konefsky, SUNY at Buffalo Law School<p></p><br></p><h2>Bridging the Gap: College Reading (12th Edition)</h2><p><br> <i> For courses in Developmental Reading. </i> <br> <b>Builds on the skills for college reading success</b> <b> <i>Bridging the Gap</i> </b> encourages students to build on their previous reading experience to develop strategies for the demands of college reading.

Decades later, the people of Henry's village are still racked by guilt and troubled by uncertainty--who, or what, drove Miss Channing to madness and murder? Henry Griswald, narrator of <i>The Chatham School Affair</i>, holds the key. Using the same dark, brooding tone that permeated <i>Breakheart Hill</i>, Thomas Cook has crafted a disturbing yet entertaining psychological thriller.When Malcolm Gaines asks attorney Henry Griswald to draw up his will, he resurrects the long-buried secret which haunts both their lives: the truth behind the tragic events the world knew as the Chatham School Affair, the controversial tragedy that destroyed five lives, shattered a quiet community, and forever scarred the two men.

There his life of 39 years ended, but the power of his faith stays with us through his life&#39;s story and through his prison cell.</p><p>This short but profound book is a meditation on the significance of the birth of Jesus to the lives of all Christians. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a Christian theologian executed for his role in a conspiracy to murder Hitler, seeks to unite the religious and the secular in an ethical humanism. The nativity of Christ in the manger speaks directly to this unity: it addresses a Christian's attitude toward the lowly, Christian experience--being humble in facing God and the world. "Who among us will celebrate Christmas right?" Bonhoeffer asks. He answers, "those who finally lay down all their power, honor, and prestige, all their vanity, pride, and self-will at the manger." Brief, poetic selections from two Bonhoeffer sermons, <i>The Mystery of Holy Night</i> provides material for meditation on the meaning of Christmas and of Christianity.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Reading, Writing, and Learning in ESL: A Resource Book for Teaching K-12 English Learners (6th Edition)</h2><p><p>In this comprehensive, accessible guide, pre- and in-service K-12 teachers get a firm understanding of the essential topics of first and second language acquisition along with teaching and assessment strategies for oral language development, vocabulary, writing, reading, and reading and writing across the curriculum.

If you seek information or guidance through channeling, through mediumship, or through the words and visions of mystics, you are also working with the beings of the subtle realms. Spirit Speak presents a unified system for understanding a broad range of nonphysical beings that we call spirits. Dominguez is able to make complex ideas accessible, through analogy and example, without oversimplifying. This comprehensive book can be understood and appreciated by readers from all different faiths, backgrounds, and levels of experience. It explores concepts such as: * spiritual lineage * the assumption of god forms * divine embodiment * the limits and potential for many spiritual practices. A hidden classic in many spiritual communities for years, <i>Spirit Speak</i> is now available with new material and fresh insights.</p><p>"This book is helpful to anyone wanting to explore the concepts of drawing down, aspecting or possession, dealing with the disincarnate, and plumbing the concept of magical contacts. Dominguez also gives advice on helping others through such experiences, making this a valuable resource for teachers, priestesses, and counselors. There is information here that I, in 25 years of magical study, had not readily encountered before."<br><p>--T. Thorn Coyle, author of <i>Evolutionary Witchcraft</i><br> <br> "This is the `nuts and bolts' of working with spirits.

For generations it has served as a bedtime story for Indian children, while at the same time engaging the interest of philosophers and theologians. Believed to have been composed by Valmiki sometime between the eighth and sixth centuries BCE, the Ramayana tells the tragic and magical story of Rama, the prince of Ayodhya, an incarnation of Lord Visnu, born to rid the earth of the terrible demon Ravana. An idealized heroic tale ending with the inevitable triumph of good over evil, the Ramayana is also an intensely personal story of family relationships, love and loss, duty and honor, of harem intrigue, petty jealousies, and destructive ambitions. All this played out in a universe populated by larger-than-life humans, gods and celestial beings, wondrous animals and terrifying demons. With her magnificent translation and superb introduction, Arshia Sattar has successfully bridged both time and space to bring this ancient classic to modern English readers.</p><p>Arshia Sattar holds a PhD in South Asian Languages and Civilizations from the University of Chicago. Her books include Lost Loves: Exploring Rama&#x2019;s Anguish and English translations of Valmiki&#x2019;s Uttara Kanda and the Kathasaritsagara. She is also the author of a prose version for young readers, Ramayana: An Illustrated Retelling (Restless Books, 2018).An essential text for my Ramayana course. I've found nothing that comes near Arshia Sattar's abridged translation for students and general readers. (Ed Yazijian, Furman University)<br><br>Of all the many translations of the Ramayana into English, Arshia Sattar's is the only one that is both accurate and a pleasure to read. It is true to the Sanskrit but also true to the spirit of the original text, revealing meanings and overtones that other translators have missed or edited out for political reasons. The language is contemporary, bringing the moral complexities of the characters to life in ways that show how very relevant they still are to life in India today. (Wendy Doniger, University of Chicago)<br><br>There are many Ramayanas in English, and some of them follow Valmiki&#x2019;s narrative faithfully, but their English is wooden, unreadable, and opaque. Other texts are written in modern English but they deviate from Valmiki. Arshia Sattar&#x2019;s retelling is a lone exception. Her one-volume abridged telling of the Ramayana brings Valmiki&#x2019;s narrative faithfully and beautifully to the English audience. Dr. Sattar is a formidable Sanskrit scholar who writes expressive English prose, two qualities rarely combined in one person. Her reading of Valmiki is sensitively interpretive, but more significantly she hears the music of Valmiki&#x2019;s text, which she effectively brings to her English prose&#x2014;an extraordinary achievement indeed. Narrative faithfulness could easily be mechanical, but Sattar avoids it by close attention to the aesthetic liveliness of Valmiki&#x2019;s text. This is the best Valmiki in English, and a most rewarding read for anyone who enjoys a superb story that has lasted centuries. (Velcheru Narayana Rao, author of Text and Tradition in South India)<br><br>Arshia Sattar&#x2019;s vibrant translation succeeds in drawing out the enchantment that this timeless story has held for countless audiences across centuries. With remarkable skill, Sattar navigates the challenge of making the text and sentiments of a nearly three-thousand-year-old story speak to a modern sensibility without losing the distinctive poetic flavor of the Valmiki text. Her critical introduction, written lucidly and beautifully, engages the major issues that come with translating a text that is also a diverse, living tradition. Arshia Sattar's insightful analysis of the salient features and themes of this text makes this edition itself a classic.

The children of Italian immigrants were kidnapped, and dozens of innocent victims were gunned down. Bombs tore apart tenement buildings. Judges, senators, Rockefellers, and society matrons were threatened with gruesome deaths. The perpetrators seemed both omnipresent and invisible. Their only calling card: the symbol of a black hand. The crimes whipped up the slavering tabloid press and heated ethnic tensions to the boiling point. Standing between the American public and the Black Hand&#x2019;s lawlessness was Joseph Petrosino. Dubbed the &#x201c;Italian Sherlock Holmes,&#x201d; he was a famously dogged and ingenious detective, and a master of disguise. As the crimes grew ever more bizarre and the Black Hand&#x2019;s activities spread far beyond New York&#x2019;s borders, Petrosino and the all-Italian police squad he assembled raced to capture members of the secret criminal society before the country&#x2019;s anti-immigrant tremors exploded into catastrophe. Petrosino&#x2019;s quest to root out the source of the Black Hand&#x2019;s power would take him all the way to Sicily&#x2014;but at a terrible cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfolding a story rich with resonance in our own era, <i>The Black Hand</i> is fast-paced narrative history at its very best.</p><p>STEPHAN TALTY is the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of six acclaimed nonfiction books and two crime novels.

A storytelling competition between a group of pilgrims from all walks of life is the occasion for a series of tales that range from the Knight&#x2019;s account of courtly love and the ebullient Wife of Bath&#x2019;s Arthurian legend, to the ribald anecdotes of the Miller and the Cook. Nevill Coghill&#x2019;s masterly and vivid modern English verse translation is rendered with consummate skill to retain all the vigor and poetry of Chaucer&#x2019;s fourteenth-century Middle English.</p><p>On a spring day in April--sometime in the waning years of the 14th century--29 travelers set out for Canterbury on a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Thomas Beckett. Among them is a knight, a monk, a prioress, a plowman, a miller, a merchant, a clerk, and an oft-widowed wife from Bath. Travel is arduous and wearing; to maintain their spirits, this band of pilgrims entertains each other with a series of tall tales that span the spectrum of literary genres. Five hundred years later, people are still reading Geoffrey Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. If you haven't yet made the acquaintance of the Franklin, the Pardoner, or the Squire because you never learned Middle English, take heart: this edition of the <i>Tales</i> has been translated into modern idiom. <p> From the heroic romance of "The Knight's Tale" to the low farce embodied in the stories of the Miller, the Reeve, and the Merchant, Chaucer treated such universal subjects as love, sex, and death in poetry that is simultaneously witty, insightful, and poignant. <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> is a grand tour of 14th-century English mores and morals--one that modern-day readers will enjoy.</p>This textbook series provides concise and lucid introductions to major works of literature, from classical antiquity to the twentieth century. Each book provides close reading of the text, as well as giving a full account of its historical, cultural and intellectual background, a discussion of its influence, and further reading.</p><h2>ASP.NET Core in Action</h2><p><p><b>Summary</b></p> <p><i>ASP.NET Core in Action</i> is for C# developers without any web development experience who want to get started and productive fast using ASP.NET Core 2.0 to build web applications.</p> <p>Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.</p> <p><b>About the Technology</b></p> <p>The dev world has permanently embraced open platforms with flexible tooling, and ASP.NET Core has changed with it.

(Wicksell Lectures)</h2><p><p>The rapid collapse of socialism has raised new economic policy questions and revived old theoretical issues. In this book, Joseph Stiglitz explains how the neoclassical, or Walrasian model (the formal articulation of Adam Smith's invisible hand), which has dominated economic thought over the past half century, may have wrongly encouraged the belief that market socialism could work. Stiglitz proposes an alternative model, based on the economics of information, that provides greater theoretical insight into the workings of a market economy and clearer guidance for the setting of policy in transitional economies.</p><p>Stiglitz sees the critical failing in the standard neoclassical model underlying market socialism to be its assumptions concerning information, particularly its failure to consider the problems that arise from lack of perfect information and from the costs of acquiring information. He also identifies problems arising from its assumptions concerning completeness of markets, competitiveness of markets, and the absence of innovation. Stiglitz argues that not only did the existing paradigm fail to provide much guidance on the vital question of the choice of economic systems, the advice it did provide was often misleading.</p></p><p>Joseph Stiglitz, a 2001 Nobel Laureate, is University Professor at Columbia University.<p>A disproportionate amount of the best in modern economics is Stiglitz's creation. This book uses it to illuminate a classic question concerning the organization of the public side of our lives. Judged in terms of both depth and reach, this elegantly written volume is never less than what we have come to expect for one of the most significant social thinkers of our time.</p>&#x2015;<b>Partha Dasgupta</b>, University of Cambridge</p><h2>Lamp of Mahamudra</h2><p>Covers meditation, four aspects of yoga, five paths to enlightenment, and the three qualities of buddhahood</p><p>Text: English, Tibetan (translation)</p><h2>Main Street (Signet Classics)</h2><p>Featuring a new introduction, a classic by the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature mounts an attack on provincial mentality in small-town America through the story of the young wife of a country doctor.

Why do they think they are so exceptional? The French take pride in the fact that their history and culture have decisively shaped the values and ideals of the modern world. French ideas are no less distinct in their form: while French thought is abstract, stylish and often opaque, it has always been bold and creative, and driven by the relentless pursuit of innovation.<br><br>In <i>How the French Think</i>, the internationally-renowned historian Sudhir Hazareesingh tells the epic and tumultuous story of French intellectual thought from Descartes, Rousseau, and Auguste Comte to Sartre, Claude L?vi-Strauss, and Derrida. He shows how French thinking has shaped fundamental Westerns ideas about freedom, rationality, and justice, and how the French mind-set is intimately connected to their own way of life-in particular to the French tendency towards individualism, their passion for nature, their celebration of their historical heritage, and their fascination with death. Hazareesingh explores the French veneration of dissent and skepticism, from Voltaire to the Dreyfus Affair and beyond; the obsession with the protection of French language and culture; the rhetorical flair embodied by the <i>philosophes</i>, which today's intellectuals still try to recapture; the astonishing influence of French postmodern thinkers, including Foucault and Barthes, on postwar American education and life, and also the growing French anxiety about a globalized world order under American hegemony.<br><br><i>How the French Think</i> sweeps aside generalizations and easy stereotypes to offer an incisive and revealing exploration of the French intellectual tradition. Steeped in a colorful range of sources, and written with warmth and humor, this book will appeal to all lovers of France and of European culture.<br><br></p><p><b>Sudhir Hazareesingh</b> is a Fellow in Politics at Balliol College, Oxford, a Fellow of the British Academy, and author of the prize-winning books <i>The Legend of Napoleon</i> and <i>In the Shadow of the General</i>.

He is an excellent teller of tales with a good eye for the revealing anecdote."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Focusing with great intelligence and subtlety on distinctively French conceptions of history, nationhood, democratic participation, existentialism, and the creative tension between order and imagination....

This is above all a convivial book, true to its subtitle though not without a finely tuned bullshit detector....

From this sociological blend of liberal and conservative ideas the work moves to its core discussion of the varying accounts of modern society found in the rich works of Marx, Durkheim, and Weber. From Marx's reading of history and analysis of capitalism it moves through Durkheim's accounts of social solidarity and suicide to Weber's understanding of bureaucracy and of the religious foundations of the modern work ethic.

With the conquest of Iran by the Muslim Arabs, Zoroastrianism lost its secular power, but continued to survive as a minority faith. Despite its antiquity, it remains a living religion.</p><p>Mary Boyce is Professor Emerita of Iranian Studies at the University of London and is the author of a number of works on Zoroastrianism and Manicheanism.<strong>'Answers a real need among students of religion ... informative, original and so eminently enjoyable ...'</strong> - <em>- Journal of Asian History</em><br><br><strong>'... an excellent series.'</strong> - <em>Isabel Wollaston, Univeristy of Birmingham, Reviews in Religion and Theology</em></p><h2>Principles of Colloid and Surface Chemistry, Revised and Expanded (UNDERGRADUATE CHEMISTRY SERIES)</h2><p>This work aims to familiarize students with the fundamentals of colloid and surface science, from various types of colloids and colloidal phenomena, and classical and modern characterization/measurement techniques to applications of colloids and surface science in engineering, technology, chemistry, physics and biological and medical sciences.

Her poems are lit with magic and stark with truth: whether they speak from the imagined dwelling of her &#x201c;Abandonarium,&#x201d; or from habitats where animals are farmed and harmed &#x201c;humanely,&#x201d; or even from the surreal confines of death row, they find a voice like no other&#x2014;dazzling, intimate, startling, heartbreaking. <br><br>Eddying between the theater of the lavish and the enigmatic, between the gaudy and the unadorned, Brock-Broido&#x2019;s verse scours America for material to render unflinchingly the here and now. Grandeur devolves into a comic irony: &#x201c;We have come to terms with our Self / Like a marmoset getting out of her Great Ape suit.&#x201d; She dares the unexplained: &#x201c;The wings were left ajar / At the altar where I&#x2019;ve knelt all night, trembling, leaning, rough / As sugar raw, and sweet.&#x201d; Each poem is a rebellious chain of words: &#x201c;Be good, they said, and so too I was / Good until I was not.&#x201d; Strange narratives, interior and exterior, make a world that is foreign and yet our own; like Dickinson, Brock-Broido constructs a spider-sibling, commanding the &#x201c;silk spool of the recluse as she confects her eventual mythomania.&#x201d; And why create the web?

But he&#x2019;s best known around the world for leading efforts to help communities deal with their waste in sustainable ways&#x2014;in other words, to eliminate and reuse waste rather than burn it or stow it away in landfills. <br> <br> In <em>The Zero Waste Solution</em>, Connett profiles the most successful zero-waste initiatives around the world, showing activists, planners, and entrepreneurs how to re-envision their community&#x2019;s waste-handling process&#x2014;by consuming less, turning organic waste into compost, recycling, reusing other waste,&nbsp; demanding nonwasteful product design, and creating jobs and bringing community members together in the process. The book also exposes the greenwashing behind renewed efforts to promote waste incinerators as safe, nontoxic energy suppliers, and gives detailed information on how communities can battle incineration projects that, even at their best, emit dangerous particles into the atmosphere, many of which remain unregulated or poorly regulated. <br> <br> An important toolkit for anyone interested in creating sustainable communities, generating secure local jobs, and keeping toxic alternatives at bay.</p></p><p><p>Dr. Paul Connett, a retired professor of environmental chemistry and toxicology at St. Lawrence University, has given more than 2,000 presentations in forty-nine states and fifty-two countries on the issue of waste management.

He lives in Canton, New York.</p><p><em><strong>Library Journal-</strong></em></p> <p>"This is both a handbook for and history of the zero waste movement worldwide. Connett became involved in the movement in 1985 when an incinerator&#x2014;and its poisonous dioxin emissions&#x2014;was slated for construction near his community. He has been a major player ever since. This text has three parts: an overview of zero waste&#x2019;s history, philosophy, and practical steps; examples of initiatives worldwide; and essays by prominent activists. Connett castigates burn-and-bury (i.e., incinerators and landfills) as wasteful, expensive, and deleterious to health and presents factual backup. To &#x201c;reduce, reuse, recycle&#x201d; he adds &#x201c;redesign&#x201d; to limit the flood of disposable goods. Connett advocates that businesses take responsibility for disposal of goods not easily recycled. San Francisco&#x2019;s zero waste prominence is no surprise, but Italy&#x2019;s is eye-opening.

Through a careful evaluation of the New Testament (and other surviving sources, including the more recently discovered Gospels of Thomas and Peter), Ehrman proposes that Jesus can be best understood as an apocalyptic prophet--a man convinced that the world would end dramatically within the lifetime of his apostles and that a new kingdom would be created on earth. According to Ehrman, Jesus' belief in a coming apocalypse and his expectation of an utter reversal in the world's social organization not only underscores the radicalism of his teachings but also sheds light on both the appeal of his message to society's outcasts and the threat he posed to Jerusalem's established leadership.<br></p><p>C.S. Lewis once noted that nowhere do the Gospels say, "Jesus laughed." He's probably laughing now, if he's got access to Bart Ehrman's <i>Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium</i>. The title doesn't even hint at the yuks that Ehrman's prose delivers, but from its very first page, <i>Jesus</i> will tickle your funny bone and stimulate your brain. "At last count," Ehrman begins, "there were something like 8 zillion books written about Jesus .... It's not there aren't <i>enough</i> books about Jesus out there. It's that there aren't enough of the right <i>kind</i> of book. Very, very few, in fact. I'd say about one and a half." <p> The right <i>kind</i> of book, according to Ehrman, is one that portrays Jesus roughly as Albert Schweitzer did, as a first-century Jewish apocalypticist: "This is a shorthand way of saying that Jesus fully expected that the history of the world as we know it (well, as he knew it) was going to come to a screeching halt, that God was soon going to intervene in the affairs of this world, overthrow the forces of evil in a cosmic act of judgment, destroy huge masses of humanity, and abolish existing human political and religious institutions. All this would be a prelude to the arrival of a new order on earth, the Kingdom of God." Ehrman's is a historical-Jesus book, a very smart, humble, and humorous popular summary of Christian and secular evidence of Jesus' life, work, and legacy. He believes that apocalypticism is the true core of Jesus' message, and that comfortable middle-class complacency among scholars, clergy, and laypeople has forged a counterfeit, domesticated, "ethical" Jesus to cover up their befuddlement about his misprediction of the apocalypse. The book will frustrate many readers because it offers no real guidance regarding what one should <i>do</i> with Jesus' apocalypticism. Its project--to prove that Jesus was wrong about the apocalypse--may even appear destructive to some. Yet the argument is convincing enough to induce among careful readers a constructive experience of confusion. <i>Jesus</i> makes readers ask the very question it appears to ignore, in a newly humble way: how, then, should we live? A serious matter, but considering humanity's endless string of wrong answers and infinite capacity for self-delusion, worthy of some good belly laughs, as well. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p><br><strong>Bart D.

Confronted with evidence that his uncle murdered his father, and with his mother&#x2019;s infidelity, Hamlet must find a means of reconciling his longing for oblivion with his duty as avenger. The ghost, Hamlet&#x2019;s feigned madness, Ophelia&#x2019;s death and burial, the play within a play, the &#x201c;closet scene&#x201d; in which Hamlet accuses his mother of complicity in murder, and breathtaking swordplay are just some of the elements that make <b>Hamlet</b> an enduring masterpiece of the theater.<br><br>Each Edition Includes:<br>� Comprehensive explanatory notes <br>� Vivid introductions and the most up-to-date scholarship <br>� Clear, modernized spelling and punctuation, enabling contemporary readers to understand the Elizabethan English<br>� Completely updated, detailed bibliographies and performance histories <br>� An interpretive essay on film adaptations of the play, along with an extensive filmography</p><p>This edition tells the story of Hamlet in production, from Burbage at the Globe to Branagh on film, relating stage interpretations to developments in the theatre, in literary criticism and in society.

The introduction focuses not only on star Hamlets, but on whole productions of the play including supporting players and, in this century, direction and design.<p>In this quintessential Shakespeare tragedy, a young prince's halting pursuit of revenge for the murder of his father unfolds in a series of highly charged confrontations that have held audiences spellbound for nearly four centuries. Those fateful exchanges, and the anguished soliloquies that precede and follow them, probe depths of human feeling rarely sounded in any art.<br>The title role of Hamlet, perhaps the most demanding in all of Western drama, has provided generations of leading actors their greatest challenge. Yet all the roles in this towering drama are superbly delineated, and each of the key scenes offers actors a rare opportunity to create theatrical magic.<br>As if further evidence of Shakespeare's genius were needed, <i>Hamlet</i> is a unique pleasure to read as well as to see and hear performed.

The Kota have developed an astonishing creativity in their representations of their ancestors. Their dreamlike figures combine a sharp sense of stylized reality tending towards abstraction with an extraordinary and imaginative use of copper, tin, and iron for purposes of decoration. But what seems to have been just a matter of aesthetic 'taste' has in fact a symbolic function, as most of the decorative motifs and the choice of the technique are linked to the Kota's kinship system or religious beliefs. The same applies to the use of copper, which was a rare material and consequently a mark of wealth and power in their society. The mbulu-ngulu reliquary figure was an icon, the visual sign of a world in which the ancestors continued to watch over their descendants. In Kota lands it was an essential 'tool' in group survival, one that enabled a continuous communication to be established between the living and the dead. The reliquary figures and initiation masks of the Kota and Mbete served as aides-m�moire and instruments useful in arousing the forces of the netherworld among the Gabonese and Congolese in times past. Together with the Fang byeri and other nkisi punu, in their various forms they have gradually become the time-honored emblems of the culture and ancestral values of the peoples of the great African equatorial forest.</p><p>Louis Perrois is an ethnologist specializing in the ancient arts and cultures of equatorial Africa.

This powerful tale written by a consummate Charleston insider and set in the historic city resonates with universal appeal.<br>Daring to touch on topics that had been taboo, Three O'Clock Dinner reveals how the modern world has intruded in a most unwelcome way upon the Redcliffes, a Charleston family long on pedigree but short on cash. Mortified when their son "Tat" elopes with the henna-haired daughter of the Hessenwinkles, an especially galling bourgeois clan, the Redcliffes are determined to respond with civility. They invite their son, his new wife, and her family for Sunday dinner, served at the traditional time of three in the afternoon. Tension builds across an expanse of white damask. After mint julep aperitifs, dinner claret, and Madeira toasts, a chance remark ignites the novel's climax amid a flurry of raised voices, hurt feelings, and broken china. Their new daughter-in-law's revelation further shatters the Redcliffe's well-ordered society but opens a door to forgiveness and redemption.<br>Barbara L. Bellow's introduction places the novel in its historical context, illuminates the history of its publication and treatment in the hands of Hollywood producers, and provides an in-depth critical analysis.</p><p>JOSEPHINE PINCKNEY (1895&#x2013;1957) was born in Charleston, South Carolina, where she maintained a home. She traveled widely and spent much of her time in New York City and New England. A published poet as well as the author of five novels, Pinckney was a founder of the Poetry Society of South Carolina in 1920 and a citizen deeply involved in Charleston's cultural life, especially historic preservation and the preservation of African American spirituals. <p>BARBARA L.

This controversial classic from the heart of the American civil rights movement explores the contradictions and extremities at the heart of the American experience, and is especially timely in the age of Donald Trump. Avedon&#39;s subjects range from intellectuals, politicians, a former slave, newlyweds, preacher Billy Graham, pop singers, and civil rights activists, shot in his signature formal and graphic black and white, often tightly cropped. The collection is all the more poignant through its bold and deliberate juxtaposition of specific images, such as Jewish gay poet /Vilen Ginsberg placed opposite the American Nazi Party. Avedon&#39;s work with mental asylum patients, shot in a grainy documentary style, is equally harrowing, although he chooses to end Nothing Personal on a hopeful, positive note, with images of children and parents reveling in the Californian ocean. The photographs are complemented by Baldwin&#39;s four-part polemic: a critique of a society that he feels is unjust, alienating, divisive, ancf therefore in the midst of an existential crisis. In a highly personal and pertinent testimony, Baldwin openly writes about his own experience of harassment by a racist policeman on the streets of New York. Designed by Marvin Israel, Nothing Personal is also an art-directed triumph from the Mad Men era. An &#34;oversized&#34; book in its own white slipcase, the minimal and striking placement of images and text alike revolutionized the packaging of photography books. This is a meticulous reprint of the original, which has long been out of print, produced in close collaboration with the Richard Avedon Foundation. A 72-page accompanying booklet features never-before-seen outtakes, contact sheets, portraits of the authors at work, preliminary layouts, correspondence, ephemera, and an essay by Baldwin expert and Pulitzer Prize winner Hilton Als. Als traces the making of Nothing Personal and documents the personal and creative relationship between Avedon and Baldwin, who were high school friends in the 1940s. Als also movingly reflects on how Nothing Personal impacted his own life, as well as his friendship with Avedon. When published, Nothing Personals dark, disturbing vision of America inevitably divided critics, and Avedon in particular endured harsh criticism. Some felt that a fashion photographer had no place in dabbling in social commentary, while others found his book to be an elitist statement by New York liberals, unrepresentative of the true feelings of &#34;real&#34; Americans.

Written for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students, as well as for practicing professionals, the book combines an emphasis on the empirical research basis of human factors with comprehensive coverage of basic concepts in the field of human factors and ergonomics. This edition of Human Factors in Engineering and Design has been thoroughly updated and contains a new chapter on motor skills. Several chapters have been extensively revised and renamed to reflect current emphases and research in the field.</p><p></p><h2>The Oxford Illustrated History of World War II</h2><p>World War Two was the most devastating conflict in recorded human history. It was both global in extent and total in character. It has understandably left a long and dark shadow across the decades. Yet it is three generations since hostilities formally ended in 1945 and the conflict is now a lived memory for only a few. And this growing distance in time has allowed historians to think differently about how to describe it, how to explain its course, and what subjects to focus on when considering the wartime experience. <br><br>For instance, as World War Two recedes ever further into the past, even a question as apparently basic as when it began and ended becomes less certain. Was it 1939, when the war in Europe began? Or the summer of 1941, with the beginning of Hitler's war against the Soviet Union? Or did it become truly global only when the Japanese brought the USA into the war at the end of 1941? And what of the long conflict in East Asia, beginning with the Japanese aggression in China in the early 1930s and only ending with the triumph of the Chinese Communists in 1949? <br><br>In <em>The Oxford Illustrated History of World War Two</em> a team of leading historians re-assesses the conflict for a new generation, exploring the course of the war not just in terms of the Allied response but also from the viewpoint of the Axis aggressor states. Under Richard Overy's expert editorial guidance, the contributions take us from the genesis of war, through the action in the major theatres of conflict by land, sea, and air, to assessments of fighting power and military and technical innovation, the economics of total war, the culture and propaganda of war, and the experience of war (and genocide) for both combatants and civilians, concluding with an account of the transition from World War to Cold War in the late 1940s. Together, they provide a stimulating and thought-provoking new interpretation of one of the most terrible and fascinating episodes in world history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Richard Overy</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Exeter. He is the author of more than twenty five books on the history of twentieth-century war and dictatorship, including the highly acclaimed <em>Why the Allies Won</em> (1995) and the prize-winning <em>Dictators: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia</em> (2004). He is a Fellow of the British Academy and a Member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts.

Yes, we do, especially this volume, which combines a breadth and depth not seen in much military history writing.

Working in small teams, students find that knowledge contributes to power, friendship and fun. Because content and the necessary student collaboration skills must be taught, teachers need to develop skills if they are to use this model successfully. The dividends are 'turned-on ' students and satisfied teachers."<br>--Madeline Hunter, University of California at Los Angeles <p>"<em>Choice Theory in the Classroom</em> is a landmark book, without question one of the most important and useful books for teachers to appear in a long while. Written with rare lucidity and grace, the book has numerous instantly usable ideas that will contribute fundamentally to the success of classroom teachers. William Glasser combines his extensive theoretical expertise and wide practical experience to provide a practical and illuminating guide for teachers [that] should be required reading in every college of education in the country."<br>--David and Roger Johnson, University of Minnesota</p><p>"<em>Choice Theory in the Classroom</em> presents an insightful analysis of what is wrong with traditional school and what need to be done about it. Dr. Glasser gives a compelling rationale for the use of learning-teams in schools to capture the excitement and commitment students display in sports but rarely in the classroom. The book is well written and persuasive. I hope every teacher in America buys it, believes it, and behaves accordingly."<br>--Robert Slavin, John Hopkins University</p></blockquote></p><p><p>William Glasser, M.D., is a world-renowned psychiatrist who lectures widely. His numerous books have sold 1.7 million copies, and he has trained thousands of counselors in his Choice Theory and Reality Therapy approaches. He is also the president of the William Glasser Institute in Los Angeles.</p>&#34;A few weeks after I received this book, I showed it to my television audience and said, &#39;This is a fabulous book.&#39; I was impressed with its clarity, its many examples, and how we can all use it to improve our marriages, get along better with our families, and persuade our children to do well in school. Choice theory, as Dr. Glasser explains it, is a new psychology of health and joy.&#34;-- Dr. Robert H. Schuller, Founding Pastor, Crystal Cathedral Ministries &#34;&#34;Choice Theory&#34; is absolutely superb both in its ideas and in the way that it is presented in this book. It is in a class of its own in clarity and depth of understanding and is exceedingly helpful in clinical practice.&#34;-- Dr. Robert Lefever, director of the PROMIS Recovery Centres, UK &#34;Bill Glasser has always demonstrated insight and understanding in describing human behavior.

Much of what we know today of those events comes from contemporary accounts by secular writers; their perspective is balanced by a document written from a monastic point of view and now available for the first time in English.</p><p>The <i>Hystoria Constantinopolitana</i> relates the adventures of Martin of Pairis, an abbot of the Cistercian Order who participated in the plunder of the city, as recorded by his monk Gunther. Written to justify the abbot's pious pilferage of scared relics and his transporting them back to his monastery in Alsace, it is a work of Christian metahistory that shows how the sack of Constantinople fits into God's plan for humanity, and that deeds done under divine guidance are themselves holy and righteous.</p><p>The <i>Hystoria Constantinopolitana</i> is one of the most complex and sophisticated historiographical work of its time, deftly interweaving moods and motifs, themes and scenes. In producing the first English translation and analysis of this work, Alfred Andrea has captured the full flavor of the original with its alternating section of prose and poetry. His introduction to the text provides background on Gunther's life and work and explores the monk's purpose in writing the <i>Hystoria Constantinopolitana</i>&#x2014;not the least of which was extolling the virtues of Abbott Martin, who was sometimes accuse of laxity by his superiors in the Order.</p><p>Gunther's work is significant for its effort to deal with problems raised by the participation of monks in the Crusades, making it a valuable contribution to both crusading and monastic history. <i>The Capture of Constantinople</i> adds to our knowledge of the Fourth Crusade and provides unusual insight into the attitudes of the participants and the cultural-intellectual history of the early thirteenth century.</p></p><p>Alfred J.

Our calling requires us to analyze past events, but we rarely turn our interpretive talents upon ourselves. I welcome the opportunity to reflect publicly about how and why I became a historian, how my approach to the study of history has changed over time, and how the concerns of the present have helped to shape the questions I ask about the past.Born in New York City in 1943, I was raised in Long Beach, Long Island, to all outward appearances a typical child of America's postwar suburban boom. In one respect, however,my upbringing was unusual, although emblematic nonetheless of one aspect of the American experience. Shortly before I was born, my father, Jack D. Foner, and uncle, Philip S. Foner, both historians at City College in New York, were among some sixty faculty members dismissed from teaching positions at the City University after informers named them as members of the Communist party at hearings of the state legislature's notorious Rapp-Coudert Committee, a precursor of McCarthyism. A few years later, my mother was forced to resign from her job as a high school art teacher. During my childhood and for many years afterward, my parents were blacklisted and unable to teach. Unlike most of my generation, I did not have to wait until the upheavals of the 1960s to discover the yawning gap that separated America's professed ideals and its self-confident claim to be a land of liberty from its social and political reality. My friend Gabor S. Boritt, who grew up in communist Hungary and now directs the Civil War Institute at Gettysburg College, once remarked to me, "I was raised in a country where we understood that most of what the government says is untrue." "That's funny," I replied, "I grew up in the same country."Given the profession of my father and uncle, it seems in retrospect inevitable that I would become a historian. But, as I frequently tell my students, events are inevitable only after they happen. As a youth I wanted to be an astronomer, and my first published book was entitled <i>The Solar System.</i> To be sure, "published" is a bit of an exaggeration. The book, with one chapter on each planet, was dictated by me, typed by my mother, and illustrated by a family friend. It was not based on archival research. But I was only seven years old at the time.My greatest joy as a youth was gazing through a telescope on spring nights, and my idea of athletic prowess was servingon the Long Beach High School math team (we finished second in Long Island one year). But I also imbibed a lively interest in both history and current events. Historical and political concerns suffused our household. Every child thinks his upbringing is entirely normal. Only gradually did I realize that other families did not discuss the intricacies of international relations and domestic politics over the dinner table, or follow election returns in France, India, and Guatemala as avidly as those in the United States.What was truly distinctive about my family's view of both American history and the world around us, however, was our preoccupation with the past and present condition of our black fellow countrymen. As suburbs go, Long Beach was a liberal community, whose predominantly Jewish residents regularly voted Democratic. But on issues relating to race, the prevailing sentiment was indifference. Our idyllic town had its own small ghetto, home to black domestic servants, but no one except my parents and a few like-minded friends seemed aware of its existence, or wondered why housing there was so inferior to that enjoyed by whites. In school, we did commemorate Negro History Week, mostly with lessons about George Washington Carver and his amazing feats with peanuts. But our history texts were typical of the time: slavery, they taught, was a regrettable but not particularly oppressive institution, Reconstruction a terrible mistake, and blacks played no discernible role whatever in the rest of American history. I well recall my mother (to my embarrassment) striding into school to complain about the illustrations of happy slaves playing banjos in our primary school history text. The principal could not understand her unhappiness. "What difference does it make," he asked, "what we teach them about slavery?"In my home, however, it made a great deal of difference. As the work of Mark Naison and other scholars has shown, in the 1930s the Communist party was the only predominantly white organization to make fighting racism central to its political program. Communist-oriented historians like Herbert Aptheker and my uncle Philip Foner, along with black scholars like W.E.B. Du Bois, had begun the process of challenging prevailing stereotypes about black history. At home, I learned ideas that today are taken for granted but then were virtually unknown outside black and left-wing circles: slavery was the fundamental cause of the Civil War and emancipation its greatest accomplishment; Reconstruction was a tragedy not because it was attempted but because it failed; and the condition of blacks was the nation's foremost domestic problem. Du Bois and Paul Robeson were friends of my family, Frederick Douglass (whom my uncle had rescued from historical oblivion by publishing a four-volume collection of his magnificent writings and speeches) a household name. In my home, we followed with a growing sense of excitement the unfolding of the civil rights movement, and it was assumed that my younger brother and I would participate in it. Tom went on to take part in the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964. I attended not only the March on Washington of 1963 but also the less well-known march of 1957, and in 1960 I spent a great deal of time picketing Woolworth stores in New York in support of the Southern sit-ins. By then, I was a freshman at Columbia College, where during my undergraduate years I became the first president of ACTION, a student political party that, along with sponsoring folk music concerts, issued newsletters on civil rights and persuaded the off-campus housing registry to drop listings from landlords who would not sign a nondiscrimination pledge.I entered Columbia fully intending to major in astronomy. By the end of my sophomore year, my interest--or perhaps my talent--in science had waned considerably. Then, in my junior year, I somehow persuaded James P. Shenton to allow me to enroll in his senior seminar on the Civil War period. By the end of the year, I was not only a history major but had developed what has become a lifelong passion for that era.Looking back over my career, I realize that I learned from two great teachers what it is to be a historian. The first was my father. Deprived of his livelihood while I was growing up, he supported our family as a freelance lecturer on history and current affairs. Listening to his lectures, I came to appreciate how present concerns can be illuminated by the study of the past--how the repression of the McCarthy era recalled the days of the Alien and Sedition Acts, how the civil rights movement needed to be viewed in light of the great struggles of black and white abolitionists, and how in the brutal suppression of the Philippine insurrection at the turn of the century could be found the antecedents of American intervention in Iran, Guatemala, and Vietnam. I also imbibed a way of thinking about the past in which visionaries and underdogs--Tom Paine, Wendell Phillips, Eugene V. Debs, and W.E.B. Du Bois--were as central to the historical drama as presidents and captains of industry, and how a commitment to social justice could infuse one's attitudes toward the past. The second great teacher was Jim Shenton, legendary at Columbia for his dramatic lecturing style and the personal interest he took in his students--down to introducing us to the city's culinary attractions. From Shenton, I learned that successful teaching rests both on a genuine and selfless concern for students and on the ability to convey to them a love of history.My seminar paper that year was a study of the Free Soil party of 1848, a justifiably obscure topic that led to my first excursion into archival research, in my senior thesis, supervised by Richard Hofstadter. The fact that the civil rights movement was then reaching its crescendo powerfully affected my choice of subject: the racial attitudes of those who opposed the expansion of slavery. Just two years earlier, Leon Litwack had stunned the historical profession with his demonstration, in <i>North of Slavery</i>, that racism was every bit as pervasive in the antebellum North as in the slave South. My research built on his insight, to demonstrate that many Free Soilers opposed the expansion of slavery in order to keep blacks, free or slave, from competing with "free white labor."My senior thesis became the basis of my first two published articles, which appeared in 1965. More importantly, it introduced me to Hofstadter, the premier historian of his generation, who would soon be supervising my dissertation. One day Hofstadter related to me how he had obtained his first full-time teaching position when a job opened in 1941 at the downtown branch of City College because of the dismissal of a victim of the Rapp-Coudert Committee. Students initially boycotted Hofstadter's lectures as a show of support for his purged predecessor, but eventually they returned to the classroom. Ironically, Hofstadter's first job resulted from the flourishing of the kind of political paranoia that he would later lament in his historical wr...</p><h2>A Christmas Carol and Other Christmas Stories (Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>A collection of four Christmas stories by the nineteenth-century English writer, including &#34;The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Year&#39;s Best Science Fiction, Thirteenth Annual Collection</h2><p>The thirteenth volume of this popular annual collection offers tales by such famed writers as Pat Cadigan, Greg Egan, Ursula K.

In the tradition of the best SF, Geoff Ryman explores homelessness in a credibly violent future where beggars are routinely crucified by hungry mobs. Fans will especially appreciate Dozois's introduction of talented young writers who have yet to publish their own collections or novels. Notable among these is David Murasek, whose novella, "We Were Out of Our Minds with Joy," imagines the couple of the next century almost having it all?that is, until they are issued a permit to have a child. But the truth is that all of the 24 short stories or novellas are rewarding, which is really the most outstanding feature of this collection. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mass Media Law</h2><p><p>In its twentieth edition, Mass Media Law comprehensively examines the principles of media law, First Amendment freedoms of speech, and press and assembly.

It combines fundamental topics, such as range plant physiology, range plant ecology, stocking-rate considerations, and grazing system selection, with the most recent research. The volume addresses rangeland and man, range management history, rangeland physical characteristics, description of rangeland types, plant physiology, ecology, inventory and monitoring, considerations concerning stocking rate, selection of grazing methods, methods of improving livestock distribution, range animal nutrition, range livestock production, wildlife management, manipulation of range vegetation, range management in developing countries, planning, technology, and the outlook for future. For Range Conservationist, Wildlife Biologist, Natural Resource Managers, Watershed Mangers and Foresters.</p><p>The approach has involved tempering fundamental topics, such as range plant physiology, range plant ecology, stocking rate considerations, and grazing system selection, with the most recent research. Some traditional range management concepts have been substantially altered as the result of new findings. The text emphasizes range management practices oriented toward multiple use wherever possible.Preface <p> The purpose of the fourth edition of this book is to introduce students to the science of range management coupling the latest concepts and technology with proven traditional approaches. We hope that our audience continues to include employed range managers on public and private land ranchers, wildlife biologists, soil scientists, and the growing segment of the public interested in natural resource management. We have tried to improve the text for those concerned with range management, not only in the United States but in other parts of the world as well. </p><p> Our approach has involved tempering fundamental topics such as range plant physiology, range plant ecology, stocking-rate considerations, and grazing system selection with the most recent research. Some traditional range management concepts have been altered since the third edition as the result of new findings. This is particularly true in the subject areas of grazing management, range ecology, and range plant ecology. We have placed greater emphasis on ecology and multiple use in this edition along with improving the quality of Tables and Figures. </p><p> Although approaches to range management change, the basic objectives of range management remain essentially the same as in the past. These are to provide society with meat, water, wildlife, and recreational opportunities on a sustained basis from lands unsuited for permanent cultivation. In recent years, the relative importance to society of these products has shifted on many rangelands in the United States. However, with modern range management practices, most rangelands can be made to yield near their potential of each product simultaneously. Although multiple-use has been practiced for over 30 years on federal rangelands in the United States, it is now bring more widely practiced on private rangelands as ranchers find the sale of recreational opportunities on their land to be increasingly profitable. We have tried to emphasize range management practices oriented toward multiple-use wherever possible. </p><p> Range management is distinguished from other land management disciplines in that it involves manipulation of grazing by large domestic or wild animals. Since control of grazing is the foundation of any range management program, this still receives primary emphasis in this fourth edition of our text. We have restricted our coverage of manipulation of vegetation by practices other than grazing to fundamental concepts since several other good texts are available that deal exclusively with this subject.</p></p><h2>Tarot and Astrology: The Pursuit of Destiny</h2><p>This synthesis of the ancient mysteries goes beyond astrology and Tarot to shed new light on the eternal question of personal destiny. The author examines the conditioning factors of time and birthdate and reveals a ten-day cycle formula that will help you understand yourself and others with amazing accuracy.</p><p>Abs on the Ball <br> <br>Introduction <br> Our Center, Our Powerhouse <br> When I first told people I was writing a new book called Abs on the Ball, numerous responses and reactions found me. I was reminded that for many our abdomens are an emotionally charged part of the body, a barometer of strength and vulnerability. One man, hiding behind a deep laugh that made his own belly quiver, joked about being 'ruled by his stomach.' A woman spoke about her pitch-perfect intuition, inherited from her grandmother, allowing her to discern a situation 'from her guts.' Even pronouncing the word 'abs' caused people to physically adjust their bodies, shift forward in their chairs, or stand taller. Others grabbed their bellies, folding the flesh this way and that; or hid their midsection behind grim, folded arms. One woman wryly expressed interest in if I would be baring my own belly for the book's cover. <br> Joseph Pilates, the founder of the famous Pilates Method of body conditioning, saw the abdominal area as the center, or powerhouse, of the body. He perceived the powerhouse or 'girdle of strength' as the area between the bottom rib and the pelvis, the region that connects the abdomen with the lower back and buttocks. This circular belt of supporting abdominal and spinal muscles was for Pilates, who studied yoga and zen meditation, a mental and spiritual center as well as a physical, gravitational one. This is why there is talk in a Pilates class, as well as in other mind-body disciplines, of the importance of being emotionally, not just physically supported. To lose one's center is to become unhinged and unfocused, susceptible to the chaos of the world around you. 'Strengthening the powerhouse' is not simply about toning the waist or sculpting the perfect six-pack. It is about finding balance and serenity to live in the world as it is. <br> Why have I chosen a Pilates approach to Abs on the Ball even though some of the exercises presented here are not Pilates in origin? Notwithstanding the power of having a strong emotional center, the answer is a physical one. One of the key principles of the Pilates Method is that movement should be initiated from the Powerhouse. So before each Pilates exercise one braces the core by pulling in the navel and engaging the deep centering muscles. The goal is to keep the mid-section still while precise movements of the arms and legs are added. Each and every time! No wonder that participants new to Pilates first notice changes in their waistbands or that many in the fitness and rehabilitation world believe that the Pilates approach is the most effective and safe way to strong abdominals. Tummies flatten, pants hang loose, and low backs resist pain. But there is more going on here than meets the eye. <br> Magic, As Long as the Correct Muscles are Targeted <br> The Pilates approach will work its magic on your abdominal center as long as the proper muscles are taught to work. If the correct muscles are not targeted, and the exercises are not performed properly, the benefits of a secure back and optimal posture will not be guaranteed. Later, we will see how traditional sit-ups and ab machines actually limit the degree to which abdominal muscles can be trained. We will also understand how important it is that the body, specifically the pelvis, is in the correct position and the role that quality of movement plays in abdominal training. <br> Experts in the field of rehabilitation have known for a while that a strong abdominal core protects the spine but they were never completely sure how. In Rick Jernmett's excellent book Spinal Stabilization: The New Science of Back Pain, the role of the abdominals, especially the role that the deepest abdominal muscles have on the stabilization of the spine, is spelt out. He explains that the deep transversus abdominis attaches directly onto the spinal column and is thus able to 'stabilize individual vertebrae of the lower back, preventing excess sliding, bending, and rotation motions.' Jemmett, a physical therapist, lecturer, as well as golfer, runner and skier, reviews the latest research from Canada, the United States, Japan, and Australia on the role of the spinal column and its muscles. He concludes that various muscles of the spine have different functions. The deepest muscles and ligaments steady the spine and act as 'position sensors' supplying the brain with critical information on the position of the joints of the vertebrae. The next layer is the 'stabilizers', the deep muscles of the abdominals and back. These are the key players in the Powerhouse and their function is to stabilize the low back and spine and keep it free from pain. Finally, the outer layer consists of large superficial muscles, sometimes called the Prime Movers. The Prime Movers create powerful, one-off movements like extending the spine or lifting a leg or arm. The superficial muscles should be added into the picture only when the stabilizers provide a strong foundation for them. <br> As this important new information spreads into the fitness world more trainers and instructors are teaching the technique of 'bracing the abs' or 'moving from the core'. But before students and trainers alike can do this properly they need to make doubly sure they are targeting the correct muscles. How can the average person or athlete distinguish between a deep or superficial muscle? What will they feel if the correct connection is made? And once a deep muscle is located and trained how can it be integrated back into a healthy movement pattern?</p><h2>The Artist as Critic: Critical Writings of Oscar Wilde</h2><p>Although known primarily as the irreverent but dazzlingly witty playwright who penned <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i>, Oscar Wilde was also an able and farsighted critic.

For decades, business leaders have been equipping themselves with every book, philosophy, reward, and program the so-called experts have convinced them to buy into, yet companies everywhere continue to struggle with toxic cultures, and the unhappiness and low productivity that go with them.In Trust Factor, neuroscientist Paul Zak shows that innate brain functions hold the answers we&#x2019;ve been looking for. Put simply, the key to providing an engaging, encouraging, positive culture that keeps your employees energized is trust. When someone shows you trust, a feel-good jolt of oxytocin surges through your brain and triggers you to reciprocate. This simple mechanism creates a perpetual trust-building cycle between management and staff, and--voil�!--the end of stubborn workplace patterns.Incorporating science-backed insights for building high-trust organizations with successful examples from The Container Store, Zappos, and Herman Miller, Trust Factor explains:� How brain chemicals affect behavior� Why trust gets squashed� How to stimulate trust within your employees� And moreStop recycling the same ineffective strategies and programs for improving culture.

What makes so many good employees check out? Neuroscientist Paul Zak shows that innate brain functions hold the answers.

Keffo of Temp Slave talks about very funny pranks on the job, and advocates restoring the I.W.W. (International Workers of the World). McJob continues the analysis of the workplace and its perils. John Marr discusses his favorite bizarre murders in <i>Murder Can Be Fun.</i> A history of proletarian novels is featured, plus reviews of many independent publications. This book has been used as a textbook in university classes for cultural studies, journalism, and media criticism.</p><p>Otto von Stroheim, publisher of Tiki News, a journal of all things tiki, explains his entrance into the world of zines as a sort of epiphany: After putting a lot of time into researching tiki culture, he thought "Why don't I try to package all this knowledge I've gained into something I can share with other people? That way I can create more of a community." Such is the motivation of most of the thousands of zine enthusiasts, whether they are publishers, writers, collectors, or traders. Vale, one-time copublisher of Re/Search publications, conducted interviews with 12 practitioners?from von Stroheim to Dishwasher Pete to the editor of Eight-Track Mind?and has collected them here along with short, representative excerpts from each zine. The interviews are entertaining and capture the spirit of the culture for those new to zines, and they offer zinesters a rare chance to hear some of these legendary writers/editors/publishers out of character. Friedman, editor of Factsheet Five, a sort of yellow pages of zine publishing, has produced the perfect complement to Vale's work. Friedman collects one or two short excerpts from each of nearly 80 different zines. Whether it is the "Guide to Kids' Birthday Parties" from Hip-Hop Housewife or the workers' rights manifesto from Temp Slave, there is something for everyone here. Both books include addresses for dozens of zines. Since collecting, cataloging, and circulating zines is a librarian's nightmare, the publication of this pair of titles is an excellent opportunity for public libraries to acquire an easy-to-deal-with package of one corner of American pop culture.?Eric Bryant, "Lirbary Journal"<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Green Studies Reader: From Romanticism to Ecocriticism</h2><p>Green Studies is a booming area for study and <em>The Green Studies Reader</em> is a fantastically comprehensive selection of critical texts which address the connection between ecology, culture, and literature.

Condition: New</p><p>The rich findings of recent exploration and research are incorporated in this completely revised and greatly expanded edition of the standard work on the New World&#x2019;s most brilliant civilization&#x2014;that of the Maya people of northern Central America and southern Mexico.<br>From its shadowy beginnings centuries before Christ, the history of the Maya is traced through its periods of cultural growth, mysterious decline, renewed prosperity, and eventual downfall following the Spanish Conquest. Ever since the awesome remains of this civilization, which spanned some 2,000 years, were discovered in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the ancient Maya have attracted widespread fascination. Where had this civilization come from? How could the Maya have sustained themselves so successfully in such an inhospitable environment? What catastrophes had overwhelmed their long-abandoned cities? Today, scientific research in a variety of disciplines has made considerable progress in answering such questions.<br>Still, the allure of the maya persists. Part of this fascination undoubtedly derives from the romantic image of a &#x201c;lost civilization&#x201d; that left scores of ruined cities deep in the jungle. But the more we learn of the Maya, the deeper becomes our respect and admiration. For these were a people of astonishing achievement: in mathematics, astronomy, calendrics, an writing systems; in technology, political organization, an commerce; and in sculpture, painting, and architecture.<br>Because of the veritable explosion of reserch on the Maya in recent years, we are for the first time beginning to understad the origins of the civilization and the reasons for both its flowering and its decline. New field discoveries, new technical advances, new successes in the decipherment of Maya writing, and new theoretical perspectives on the Maya past have made necessary this present edition of The Ancient Maya<p>, which is more than one-fourth longer than the previous edition.</p>&#x201c;As readable as it is comprehensive, this volume is an admirable and up-to-date account of the ancient Maya.&#x201d;&#x2014;Scientific American<br><br>&#x201c;The most comprehensive and most lavishly illustrated book on its subject.&#x201d;&#x2014;Journal of Latin American Studies<br></p><h2>A Formal Feeling Comes: Poems in Form by Contemporary Women</h2><p>Celebrating the diverse traditions of poetic form, editor and poet Annie Finch presents illuminating examples from sixty contemporary women poets who have transformed and strengthened their literary inheritance. A Formal Feeling Comes welcomes the new millennium with intellectual clarity, emotional freedom, and a chorus of powerful voices.</p><p>If Emily Dickinson wasn&#39;t the mother of American poetry, she was at least the favorite eccentric aunt. The long-standing poetic rebellion against formalism, especially as it has helped feminist writers to find a free and authentic voice, has had the unfortunate byproduct of separating many women writers from the Dickinsonian tradition of carefully crafted verse. The discipline of poetic form can lead to a freshness of vision, and many women writers are either rediscovering, or have never forgotten, the benefits of scansion, meter, and fixed-form poetry. In this collection you&#39;ll find stunning formal poetry, which Rita Dove calls &#34;a talisman against disintegration.&#34; Annie Finch has included work from Jane Kenyon, May Sarton, and Molly Peacock, among others.Kevin Of The N.

Building on the bestselling tradition of previous editions, the long-awaited third edition combines the best features of traditional and modern teaching methods. It provides a unique course of instruction that allows students to read connected Greek narrative right from the beginning and guides them to the point where they can begin reading complete classical texts. James Morwood, editor of the <em>Oxford Grammar of Classical Greek</em> and the <em>Pocket Oxford</em> <em>Classical Greek Dictionary,</em> brings his expertise and years of teaching experience to this revision.<br><br>Carefully designed to hold students' interest, the course begins in Book I with a fictional narrative about an Attic farmer's family placed in a precise historical context (432-431 B.C.). This narrative, interwoven with tales from mythology and the Persian Wars, gradually gives way in Book II to adapted passages from Thucydides, Plato, and Herodotus and ultimately to excerpts of the original Greek of Bacchylides, Thucydides, and Aristophanes' Acharnians.

The essays are, in one way or another, informed by Dummett&#x2019;s concern with metaphysical questions and his belief that the correct approach to them is via the theory of meaning. Reflected here is Dummett&#x2019;s conviction that the concept of truth is of central importance both for the theory of meaning and for metaphysics. As he sees it, an adequate elucidation of the concept of truth requires nothing less than the construction of a satisfactory theory of meaning. At the same time, resolution of the traditional problems of metaphysics turns critically upon the way in which the concept of truth applies to each of various large ranges of statements, and especially upon whether the statements in each such range satisfy the principle that every statement must be true or false.</p><p>The book includes all Dummett&#x2019;s philosophical essays that were published or given as public lectures before August 1976, with the exception of a few he did not think it worthwhile to reprint and of the two entitled &#x201c;What Is a Theory of Meaning?&#x201d; One essay appears here for the first time in English and two have not been previously published. In an extensive preface, Dummett comments on the essays and seeks to relate them to the philosophical background against which they were written.</p></p><p>&#39;These writings. . .explore the theory of meaning as pivotally important fro the analysis of truth and. . .traditional metaphysical questions. . .Dummett&#39;s work is technical but always lucid, and it is of fundamental importance.&#39; - ChoiceMichael Dummett was Wykeham Professor of Logic, Emeritus, at the University of Oxford.</p><h2>The End of Europe: Dictators, Demagogues, and the Coming Dark Age</h2><p>Once the world&#x2019;s bastion of liberal, democratic values, Europe is now having to confront demons it thought it had laid to rest. The old pathologies of anti-Semitism, populist nationalism, and territorial aggression are threatening to tear the European postwar consensus apart. In riveting dispatches from this unfolding tragedy, James Kirchick shows us the shallow disingenuousness of the leaders who pushed for &#x201c;Brexit;&#x201d; examines how a vast migrant wave is exacerbating tensions between Europeans and their Muslim minorities; explores the rising anti-Semitism that causes Jewish schools and synagogues in France and Germany to resemble armed bunkers; and describes how Russian imperial ambitions are destabilizing nations from Estonia to Ukraine. With President Trump now threatening to abandon America's traditional role as upholder of the liberal world order and guarantor of the continent's security, Europe may be alone in dealing with these unprecedented challenges.<br> &nbsp;<br> Based on extensive firsthand reporting, this book is a provocative, disturbing look at a continent in unexpected crisis.</p><p><b>James Kirchick</b> is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, a columnist for <i>Tablet </i>magazine, and a correspondent for the Daily Beast.

It would be hard to find a better assessment of the multi-frontal assault on what had been, however briefly, a continental consensus about liberal values, trans-state integration and the essential connections between Europe and North America."&#x2014;Charles King, <i>TLS</i><br>"A young American&#x2019;s brilliant analysis of the dire state of world politics. .&nbsp;. .
